       "['BOOK XIII\\n\\n  Neptune helps the Achaeans--The feats of Idomeneus--Hector at\\n  the ships.\\n\\nNOW when Jove had thus brought Hector and the Trojans to the ships, he\\nleft them to their never-ending toil, and turned his keen eyes away,\\nlooking elsewhither towards the horse-breeders of Thrace, the Mysians,\\nfighters at close quarters, the noble Hippemolgi, who live on milk, and\\nthe Abians, justest of mankind. He no longer turned so much as a glance\\ntowards Troy, for he did not think that any of the immortals would go\\nand help either Trojans or Danaans.\\n\\nBut King Neptune had kept no blind look-out; he had been looking\\nadmiringly on the battle from his seat on the topmost crests of wooded\\nSamothrace, whence he could see all Ida, with the city of Priam and the\\nships of the Achaeans. He had come from under the sea and taken his\\nplace here, for he pitied the Achaeans who were being overcome by the\\nTrojans; and he was furiously angry with Jove.\\n\\nPresently he came down from his post on the mountain top, and as he\\nstrode swiftly onwards the high hills and the forest quaked beneath the\\ntread of his immortal feet. Three strides he took, and with the fourth\\nhe reached his goal--Aegae, where is his glittering golden palace,\\nimperishable, in the depths of the sea. When he got there, he yoked his\\nfleet brazen-footed steeds with their manes of gold all flying in the\\nwind; he clothed himself in raiment of gold, grasped his gold whip, and\\ntook his stand upon his chariot. As he went his way over the waves the\\nsea-monsters left their lairs, for they knew their lord, and came\\ngambolling round him from every quarter of the deep, while the sea in\\nher gladness opened a path before his chariot. So lightly did the\\nhorses fly that the bronze axle of the car was not even wet beneath it;\\nand thus his bounding steeds took him to the ships of the Achaeans.\\n\\nNow there is a certain huge cavern in the depths of the sea midway\\nbetween Tenedos and rocky Imbrus; here Neptune lord of the earthquake\\nstayed his horses, unyoked them, and set before them their ambrosial\\nforage. He hobbled their feet with hobbles of gold which none could\\neither unloose or break, so that they might stay there in that place\\nuntil their lord should return. This done he went his way to the host\\nof the Achaeans.\\n\\nNow the Trojans followed Hector son of Priam in close array like a\\nstorm-cloud or flame of fire, fighting with might and main and raising\\nthe cry battle; for they deemed that they should take the ships of the\\nAchaeans and kill all their chiefest heroes then and there. Meanwhile\\nearth-encircling Neptune lord of the earthquake cheered on the Argives,\\nfor he had come up out of the sea and had assumed the form and voice of\\nCalchas.\\n\\nFirst he spoke to the two Ajaxes, who were doing their best already,\\nand said, \"Ajaxes, you two can be the saving of the Achaeans if you\\nwill put out all your strength and not let yourselves be daunted. I am\\nnot afraid that the Trojans, who have got over the wall in force, will\\nbe victorious in any other part, for the Achaeans can hold all of them\\nin check, but I much fear that some evil will befall us here where\\nfurious Hector, who boasts himself the son of great Jove himself, is\\nleading them on like a pillar of flame. May some god, then, put it into\\nyour hearts to make a firm stand here, and to incite others to do the\\nlike. In this case you will drive him from the ships even though he be\\ninspired by Jove himself.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke the earth-encircling lord of the earthquake struck both of\\nthem with his sceptre and filled their hearts with daring. He made\\ntheir legs light and active, as also their hands and their feet. Then,\\nas the soaring falcon poises on the wing high above some sheer rock,\\nand presently swoops down to chase some bird over the plain, even so\\ndid Neptune lord of the earthquake wing his flight into the air and\\nleave them. Of the two, swift Ajax son of Oileus was the first to know\\nwho it was that had been speaking with them, and said to Ajax son of\\nTelamon, \"Ajax, this is one of the gods that dwell on Olympus, who in\\nthe likeness of the prophet is bidding us fight hard by our ships. It\\nwas not Calchas the seer and diviner of omens; I knew him at once by\\nhis feet and knees as he turned away, for the gods are soon recognised.\\nMoreover I feel the lust of battle burn more fiercely within me, while\\nmy hands and my feet under me are more eager for the fray.\"\\n\\nAnd Ajax son of Telamon answered, \"I too feel my hands grasp my spear\\nmore firmly; my strength is greater, and my feet more nimble; I long,\\nmoreover, to meet furious Hector son of Priam, even in single combat.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse, exulting in the hunger after battle with which\\nthe god had filled them. Meanwhile the earth-encircler roused the\\nAchaeans, who were resting in the rear by the ships overcome at once by\\nhard fighting and by grief at seeing that the Trojans had got over the\\nwall in force. Tears began falling from their eyes as they beheld them,\\nfor they made sure that they should not escape destruction; but the\\nlord of the earthquake passed lightly about among them and urged their\\nbattalions to the front.\\n\\nFirst he went up to Teucer and Leitus, the hero Peneleos, and Thoas and\\nDeipyrus; Meriones also and Antilochus, valiant warriors; all did he\\nexhort. \"Shame on you young Argives,\" he cried, \"it was on your prowess\\nI relied for the saving of our ships; if you fight not with might and\\nmain, this very day will see us overcome by the Trojans. Of a truth my\\neyes behold a great and terrible portent which I had never thought to\\nsee--the Trojans at our ships--they, who were heretofore like\\npanic-stricken hinds, the prey of jackals and wolves in a forest, with\\nno strength but in flight for they cannot defend themselves. Hitherto\\nthe Trojans dared not for one moment face the attack of the Achaeans,\\nbut now they have sallied far from their city and are fighting at our\\nvery ships through the cowardice of our leader and the disaffection of\\nthe people themselves, who in their discontent care not to fight in\\ndefence of the ships but are being slaughtered near them. True, King\\nAgamemnon son of Atreus is the cause of our disaster by having insulted\\nthe son of Peleus, still this is no reason why we should leave off\\nfighting. Let us be quick to heal, for the hearts of the brave heal\\nquickly. You do ill to be thus remiss, you, who are the finest soldiers\\nin our whole army. I blame no man for keeping out of battle if he is a\\nweakling, but I am indignant with such men as you are. My good friends,\\nmatters will soon become even worse through this slackness; think, each\\none of you, of his own honour and credit, for the hazard of the fight\\nis extreme. Great Hector is now fighting at our ships; he has broken\\nthrough the gates and the strong bolt that held them.\"\\n\\nThus did the earth-encircler address the Achaeans and urge them on.\\nThereon round the two Ajaxes there gathered strong bands of men, of\\nwhom not even Mars nor Minerva, marshaller of hosts could make light if\\nthey went among them, for they were the picked men of all those who\\nwere now awaiting the onset of Hector and the Trojans. They made a\\nliving fence, spear to spear, shield to shield, buckler to buckler,\\nhelmet to helmet, and man to man. The horse-hair crests on their\\ngleaming helmets touched one another as they nodded forward, so closely\\nserried were they; the spears they brandished in their strong hands\\nwere interlaced, and their hearts were set on battle.\\n\\nThe Trojans advanced in a dense body, with Hector at their head\\npressing right on as a rock that comes thundering down the side of some\\nmountain from whose brow the winter torrents have torn it; the\\nfoundations of the dull thing have been loosened by floods of rain, and\\nas it bounds headlong on its way it sets the whole forest in an uproar;\\nit swerves neither to right nor left till it reaches level ground, but\\nthen for all its fury it can go no further--even so easily did Hector\\nfor a while seem as though he would career through the tents and ships\\nof the Achaeans till he had reached the sea in his murderous course;\\nbut the closely serried battalions stayed him when he reached them, for\\nthe sons of the Achaeans thrust at him with swords and spears pointed\\nat both ends, and drove him from them so that he staggered and gave\\nground; thereon he shouted to the Trojans, \"Trojans, Lycians, and\\nDardanians, fighters in close combat, stand firm: the Achaeans have set\\nthemselves as a wall against me, but they will not check me for long;\\nthey will give ground before me if the mightiest of the gods, the\\nthundering spouse of Juno, has indeed inspired my onset.\"\\n\\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Deiphobus son of\\nPriam went about among them intent on deeds of daring with his round\\nshield before him, under cover of which he strode quickly forward.\\nMeriones took aim at him with a spear, nor did he fail to hit the broad\\norb of ox-hide; but he was far from piercing it for the spear broke in\\ntwo pieces long ere he could do so; moreover Deiphobus had seen it\\ncoming and had held his shield well away from him. Meriones drew back\\nunder cover of his comrades, angry alike at having failed to vanquish\\nDeiphobus, and having broken his spear. He turned therefore towards the\\nships and tents to fetch a spear which he had left behind in his tent.\\n\\nThe others continued fighting, and the cry of battle rose up into the\\nheavens. Teucer son of Telamon was the first to kill his man, to wit,\\nthe warrior Imbrius, son of Mentor, rich in horses. Until the Achaeans\\ncame he had lived in Pedaeum, and had married Medesicaste, a bastard\\ndaughter of Priam; but on the arrival of the Danaan fleet he had gone\\nback to Ilius, and was a great man among the Trojans, dwelling near\\nPriam himself, who gave him like honour with his own sons. The son of\\nTelamon now struck him under the ear with a spear which he then drew\\nback again, and Imbrius fell headlong as an ash-tree when it is felled\\non the crest of some high mountain beacon, and its delicate green\\nfoliage comes toppling down to the ground. Thus did he fall with his\\nbronze-dight armour ringing harshly round him, and Teucer sprang\\nforward with intent to strip him of his armour; but as he was doing so,\\nHector took aim at him with a spear. Teucer saw the spear coming and\\nswerved aside, whereon it hit Amphimachus, son of Cteatus son of Actor,\\nin the chest as he was coming into battle, and his armour rang rattling\\nround him as he fell heavily to the ground. Hector sprang forward to\\ntake Amphimachus\\'s helmet from off his temples, and in a moment Ajax\\nthrew a spear at him, but did not wound him, for he was encased all\\nover in his terrible armour; nevertheless the spear struck the boss of\\nhis shield with such force as to drive him back from the two corpses,\\nwhich the Achaeans then drew off. Stichius and Menestheus, captains of\\nthe Athenians, bore away Amphimachus to the host of the Achaeans, while\\nthe two brave and impetuous Ajaxes did the like by Imbrius. As two\\nlions snatch a goat from the hounds that have it in their fangs, and\\nbear it through thick brushwood high above the ground in their jaws,\\nthus did the Ajaxes bear aloft the body of Imbrius, and strip it of its\\narmour. Then the son of Oileus severed the head from the neck in\\nrevenge for the death of Amphimachus, and sent it whirling over the\\ncrowd as though it had been a ball, till it fell in the dust at\\nHector\\'s feet.\\n\\nNeptune was exceedingly angry that his grandson Amphimachus should have\\nfallen; he therefore went to the tents and ships of the Achaeans to\\nurge the Danaans still further, and to devise evil for the Trojans.\\nIdomeneus met him, as he was taking leave of a comrade, who had just\\ncome to him from the fight, wounded in the knee. His fellow-soldiers\\nbore him off the field, and Idomeneus having given orders to the\\nphysicians went on to his tent, for he was still thirsting for battle.\\nNeptune spoke in the likeness and with the voice of Thoas son of\\nAndraemon who ruled the Aetolians of all Pleuron and high Calydon, and\\nwas honoured among his people as though he were a god. \"Idomeneus,\"\\nsaid he, \"lawgiver to the Cretans, what has now become of the threats\\nwith which the sons of the Achaeans used to threaten the Trojans?\"\\n\\nAnd Idomeneus chief among the Cretans answered, \"Thoas, no one, so far\\nas I know, is in fault, for we can all fight. None are held back\\nneither by fear nor slackness, but it seems to be the will of almighty\\nJove that the Achaeans should perish ingloriously here far from Argos:\\nyou, Thoas, have been always staunch, and you keep others in heart if\\nyou see any fail in duty; be not then remiss now, but exhort all to do\\ntheir utmost.\"\\n\\nTo this Neptune lord of the earthquake made answer, \"Idomeneus, may he\\nnever return from Troy, but remain here for dogs to batten upon, who is\\nthis day wilfully slack in fighting. Get your armour and go, we must\\nmake all haste together if we may be of any use, though we are only\\ntwo. Even cowards gain courage from companionship, and we two can hold\\nour own with the bravest.\"\\n\\nTherewith the god went back into the thick of the fight, and Idomeneus\\nwhen he had reached his tent donned his armour, grasped his two spears,\\nand sallied forth. As the lightning which the son of Saturn brandishes\\nfrom bright Olympus when he would show a sign to mortals, and its gleam\\nflashes far and wide--even so did his armour gleam about him as he ran.\\nMeriones his sturdy squire met him while he was still near his tent\\n(for he was going to fetch his spear) and Idomeneus said:\\n\\n\"Meriones, fleet son of Molus, best of comrades, why have you left the\\nfield? Are you wounded, and is the point of the weapon hurting you? or\\nhave you been sent to fetch me? I want no fetching; I had far rather\\nfight than stay in my tent.\"\\n\\n\"Idomeneus,\" answered Meriones, \"I come for a spear, if I can find one\\nin my tent; I have broken the one I had, in throwing it at the shield\\nof Deiphobus.\"\\n\\nAnd Idomeneus captain of the Cretans answered, \"You will find one\\nspear, or twenty if you so please, standing up against the end wall of\\nmy tent. I have taken them from Trojans whom I have killed, for I am\\nnot one to keep my enemy at arm\\'s length; therefore I have spears,\\nbossed shields, helmets, and burnished corslets.\"\\n\\nThen Meriones said, \"I too in my tent and at my ship have spoils taken\\nfrom the Trojans, but they are not at hand. I have been at all times\\nvalorous, and wherever there has been hard fighting have held my own\\namong the foremost. There may be those among the Achaeans who do not\\nknow how I fight, but you know it well enough yourself.\"\\n\\nIdomeneus answered, \"I know you for a brave man: you need not tell me.\\nIf the best men at the ships were being chosen to go on an ambush--and\\nthere is nothing like this for showing what a man is made of; it comes\\nout then who is cowardly and who brave; the coward will change colour\\nat every touch and turn; he is full of fears, and keeps shifting his\\nweight first on one knee and then on the other; his heart beats fast as\\nhe thinks of death, and one can hear the chattering of his teeth;\\nwhereas the brave man will not change colour nor be frightened on\\nfinding himself in ambush, but is all the time longing to go into\\naction--if the best men were being chosen for such a service, no one\\ncould make light of your courage nor feats of arms. If you were struck\\nby a dart or smitten in close combat, it would not be from behind, in\\nyour neck nor back, but the weapon would hit you in the chest or belly\\nas you were pressing forward to a place in the front ranks. But let us\\nno longer stay here talking like children, lest we be ill spoken of;\\ngo, fetch your spear from the tent at once.\"\\n\\nOn this Meriones, peer of Mars, went to the tent and got himself a\\nspear of bronze. He then followed after Idomeneus, big with great deeds\\nof valour. As when baneful Mars sallies forth to battle, and his son\\nPanic so strong and dauntless goes with him, to strike terror even into\\nthe heart of a hero--the pair have gone from Thrace to arm themselves\\namong the Ephyri or the brave Phlegyans, but they will not listen to\\nboth the contending hosts, and will give victory to one side or to the\\nother--even so did Meriones and Idomeneus, captains of men, go out to\\nbattle clad in their bronze armour. Meriones was first to speak. \"Son\\nof Deucalion,\" said he, \"where would you have us begin fighting? On the\\nright wing of the host, in the centre, or on the left wing, where I\\ntake it the Achaeans will be weakest?\"\\n\\nIdomeneus answered, \"There are others to defend the centre--the two\\nAjaxes and Teucer, who is the finest archer of all the Achaeans, and is\\ngood also in a hand-to-hand fight. These will give Hector son of Priam\\nenough to do; fight as he may, he will find it hard to vanquish their\\nindomitable fury, and fire the ships, unless the son of Saturn fling a\\nfirebrand upon them with his own hand. Great Ajax son of Telamon will\\nyield to no man who is in mortal mould and eats the grain of Ceres, if\\nbronze and great stones can overthrow him. He would not yield even to\\nAchilles in hand-to-hand fight, and in fleetness of foot there is none\\nto beat him; let us turn therefore towards the left wing, that we may\\nknow forthwith whether we are to give glory to some other, or he to us.\"\\n\\nMeriones, peer of fleet Mars, then led the way till they came to the\\npart of the host which Idomeneus had named.\\n\\nNow when the Trojans saw Idomeneus coming on like a flame of fire, him\\nand his squire clad in their richly wrought armour, they shouted and\\nmade towards him all in a body, and a furious hand-to-hand fight raged\\nunder the ships\\' sterns. Fierce as the shrill winds that whistle upon a\\nday when dust lies deep on the roads, and the gusts raise it into a\\nthick cloud--even such was the fury of the combat, and might and main\\ndid they hack at each other with spear and sword throughout the host.\\nThe field bristled with the long and deadly spears which they bore.\\nDazzling was the sheen of their gleaming helmets, their fresh-burnished\\nbreastplates, and glittering shields as they joined battle with one\\nanother. Iron indeed must be his courage who could take pleasure in the\\nsight of such a turmoil, and look on it without being dismayed.\\n\\nThus did the two mighty sons of Saturn devise evil for mortal heroes.\\nJove was minded to give victory to the Trojans and to Hector, so as to\\ndo honour to fleet Achilles, nevertheless he did not mean to utterly\\noverthrow the Achaean host before Ilius, and only wanted to glorify\\nThetis and her valiant son. Neptune on the other hand went about among\\nthe Argives to incite them, having come up from the grey sea in secret,\\nfor he was grieved at seeing them vanquished by the Trojans, and was\\nfuriously angry with Jove. Both were of the same race and country, but\\nJove was elder born and knew more, therefore Neptune feared to defend\\nthe Argives openly, but in the likeness of man, he kept on encouraging\\nthem throughout their host. Thus, then, did these two devise a knot of\\nwar and battle, that none could unloose or break, and set both sides\\ntugging at it, to the failing of men\\'s knees beneath them.\\n\\nAnd now Idomeneus, though his hair was already flecked with grey,\\ncalled loud on the Danaans and spread panic among the Trojans as he\\nleaped in among them. He slew Othryoneus from Cabesus, a sojourner, who\\nhad but lately come to take part in the war. He sought Cassandra, the\\nfairest of Priam\\'s daughters, in marriage, but offered no gifts of\\nwooing, for he promised a great thing, to wit, that he would drive the\\nsons of the Achaeans willy nilly from Troy; old King Priam had given\\nhis consent and promised her to him, whereon he fought on the strength\\nof the promises thus made to him. Idomeneus aimed a spear, and hit him\\nas he came striding on. His cuirass of bronze did not protect him, and\\nthe spear stuck in his belly, so that he fell heavily to the ground.\\nThen Idomeneus vaunted over him saying, \"Othryoneus, there is no one in\\nthe world whom I shall admire more than I do you, if you indeed perform\\nwhat you have promised Priam son of Dardanus in return for his\\ndaughter. We too will make you an offer; we will give you the loveliest\\ndaughter of the son of Atreus, and will bring her from Argos for you to\\nmarry, if you will sack the goodly city of Ilius in company with\\nourselves; so come along with me, that we may make a covenant at the\\nships about the marriage, and we will not be hard upon you about gifts\\nof wooing.\"\\n\\nWith this Idomeneus began dragging him by the foot through the thick of\\nthe fight, but Asius came up to protect the body, on foot, in front of\\nhis horses which his esquire drove so close behind him that he could\\nfeel their breath upon his shoulder. He was longing to strike down\\nIdomeneus, but ere he could do so Idomeneus smote him with his spear in\\nthe throat under the chin, and the bronze point went clean through it.\\nHe fell as an oak, or poplar, or pine which shipwrights have felled for\\nship\\'s timber upon the mountains with whetted axes--even thus did he\\nlie full length in front of his chariot and horses, grinding his teeth\\nand clutching at the bloodstained dust. His charioteer was struck with\\npanic and did not dare turn his horses round and escape: thereupon\\nAntilochus hit him in the middle of his body with a spear; his cuirass\\nof bronze did not protect him, and the spear stuck in his belly. He\\nfell gasping from his chariot and Antilochus, great Nestor\\'s son, drove\\nhis horses from the Trojans to the Achaeans.\\n\\nDeiphobus then came close up to Idomeneus to avenge Asius, and took aim\\nat him with a spear, but Idomeneus was on the look-out and avoided it,\\nfor he was covered by the round shield he always bore--a shield of\\noxhide and bronze with two arm-rods on the inside. He crouched under\\ncover of this, and the spear flew over him, but the shield rang out as\\nthe spear grazed it, and the weapon sped not in vain from the strong\\nhand of Deiphobus, for it struck Hypsenor son of Hippasus, shepherd of\\nhis people, in the liver under the midriff, and his limbs failed\\nbeneath him. Deiphobus vaunted over him and cried with a loud voice\\nsaying, \"Of a truth Asius has not fallen unavenged; he will be glad\\neven while passing into the house of Hades, strong warden of the gate,\\nthat I have sent some one to escort him.\"\\n\\nThus did he vaunt, and the Argives were stung by his saying. Noble\\nAntilochus was more angry than any one, but grief did not make him\\nforget his friend and comrade. He ran up to him, bestrode him, and\\ncovered him with his shield; then two of his staunch comrades,\\nMecisteus son of Echius, and Alastor, stooped down, and bore him away\\ngroaning heavily to the ships. But Idomeneus ceased not his fury. He\\nkept on striving continually either to enshroud some Trojan in the\\ndarkness of death, or himself to fall while warding off the evil day\\nfrom the Achaeans. Then fell Alcathous son of noble Aesyetes; he was\\nson-in-law to Anchises, having married his eldest daughter Hippodameia,\\nwho was the darling of her father and mother, and excelled all her\\ngeneration in beauty, accomplishments, and understanding, wherefore the\\nbravest man in all Troy had taken her to wife--him did Neptune lay low\\nby the hand of Idomeneus, blinding his bright eyes and binding his\\nstrong limbs in fetters so that he could neither go back nor to one\\nside, but stood stock still like pillar or lofty tree when Idomeneus\\nstruck him with a spear in the middle of his chest. The coat of mail\\nthat had hitherto protected his body was now broken, and rang harshly\\nas the spear tore through it. He fell heavily to the ground, and the\\nspear stuck in his heart, which still beat, and made the butt-end of\\nthe spear quiver till dread Mars put an end to his life. Idomeneus\\nvaunted over him and cried with a loud voice saying, \"Deiphobus, since\\nyou are in a mood to vaunt, shall we cry quits now that we have killed\\nthree men to your one? Nay, sir, stand in fight with me yourself, that\\nyou may learn what manner of Jove-begotten man am I that have come\\nhither. Jove first begot Minos, chief ruler in Crete, and Minos in his\\nturn begot a son, noble Deucalion. Deucalion begot me to be a ruler\\nover many men in Crete, and my ships have now brought me hither, to be\\nthe bane of yourself, your father, and the Trojans.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and Deiphobus was in two minds, whether to go back\\nand fetch some other Trojan to help him, or to take up the challenge\\nsingle-handed. In the end, he deemed it best to go and fetch Aeneas,\\nwhom he found standing in the rear, for he had long been aggrieved with\\nPriam because in spite of his brave deeds he did not give him his due\\nshare of honour. Deiphobus went up to him and said, \"Aeneas, prince\\namong the Trojans, if you know any ties of kinship, help me now to\\ndefend the body of your sister\\'s husband; come with me to the rescue of\\nAlcathous, who being husband to your sister brought you up when you\\nwere a child in his house, and now Idomeneus has slain him.\"\\n\\nWith these words he moved the heart of Aeneas, and he went in pursuit\\nof Idomeneus, big with great deeds of valour; but Idomeneus was not to\\nbe thus daunted as though he were a mere child; he held his ground as a\\nwild boar at bay upon the mountains, who abides the coming of a great\\ncrowd of men in some lonely place--the bristles stand upright on his\\nback, his eyes flash fire, and he whets his tusks in his eagerness to\\ndefend himself against hounds and men--even so did famed Idomeneus hold\\nhis ground and budge not at the coming of Aeneas. He cried aloud to his\\ncomrades looking towards Ascalaphus, Aphareus, Deipyrus, Meriones, and\\nAntilochus, all of them brave soldiers--\"Hither my friends,\" he cried,\\n\"and leave me not single-handed--I go in great fear by fleet Aeneas,\\nwho is coming against me, and is a redoubtable dispenser of death\\nbattle. Moreover he is in the flower of youth when a man\\'s strength is\\ngreatest; if I was of the same age as he is and in my present mind,\\neither he or I should soon bear away the prize of victory.\"\\n\\nOn this, all of them as one man stood near him, shield on shoulder.\\nAeneas on the other side called to his comrades, looking towards\\nDeiphobus, Paris, and Agenor, who were leaders of the Trojans along\\nwith himself, and the people followed them as sheep follow the ram when\\nthey go down to drink after they have been feeding, and the heart of\\nthe shepherd is glad--even so was the heart of Aeneas gladdened when he\\nsaw his people follow him.\\n\\nThen they fought furiously in close combat about the body of Alcathous,\\nwielding their long spears; and the bronze armour about their bodies\\nrang fearfully as they took aim at one another in the press of the\\nfight, while the two heroes Aeneas and Idomeneus, peers of Mars,\\noutvied everyone in their desire to hack at each other with sword and\\nspear. Aeneas took aim first, but Idomeneus was on the lookout and\\navoided the spear, so that it sped from Aeneas\\' strong hand in vain,\\nand fell quivering in the ground. Idomeneus meanwhile smote Oenomaus in\\nthe middle of his belly, and broke the plate of his corslet, whereon\\nhis bowels came gushing out and he clutched the earth in the palms of\\nhis hands as he fell sprawling in the dust. Idomeneus drew his spear\\nout of the body, but could not strip him of the rest of his armour for\\nthe rain of darts that were showered upon him: moreover his strength\\nwas now beginning to fail him so that he could no longer charge, and\\ncould neither spring forward to recover his own weapon nor swerve aside\\nto avoid one that was aimed at him; therefore, though he still defended\\nhimself in hand-to-hand fight, his heavy feet could not bear him\\nswiftly out of the battle. Deiphobus aimed a spear at him as he was\\nretreating slowly from the field, for his bitterness against him was as\\nfierce as ever, but again he missed him, and hit Ascalaphus, the son of\\nMars; the spear went through his shoulder, and he clutched the earth in\\nthe palms of his hands as he fell sprawling in the dust.\\n\\nGrim Mars of awful voice did not yet know that his son had fallen, for\\nhe was sitting on the summits of Olympus under the golden clouds, by\\ncommand of Jove, where the other gods were also sitting, forbidden to\\ntake part in the battle. Meanwhile men fought furiously about the body.\\nDeiphobus tore the helmet from off his head, but Meriones sprang upon\\nhim, and struck him on the arm with a spear so that the visored helmet\\nfell from his hand and came ringing down upon the ground. Thereon\\nMeriones sprang upon him like a vulture, drew the spear from his\\nshoulder, and fell back under cover of his men. Then Polites, own\\nbrother of Deiphobus passed his arms around his waist, and bore him\\naway from the battle till he got to his horses that were standing in\\nthe rear of the fight with the chariot and their driver. These took him\\ntowards the city groaning and in great pain, with the blood flowing\\nfrom his arm.\\n\\nThe others still fought on, and the battle-cry rose to heaven without\\nceasing. Aeneas sprang on Aphareus son of Caletor, and struck him with\\na spear in his throat which was turned towards him; his head fell on\\none side, his helmet and shield came down along with him, and death,\\nlife\\'s foe, was shed around him. Antilochus spied his chance, flew\\nforward towards Thoon, and wounded him as he was turning round. He laid\\nopen the vein that runs all the way up the back to the neck; he cut\\nthis vein clean away throughout its whole course, and Thoon fell in the\\ndust face upwards, stretching out his hands imploringly towards his\\ncomrades. Antilochus sprang upon him and stripped the armour from his\\nshoulders, glaring round him fearfully as he did so. The Trojans came\\nabout him on every side and struck his broad and gleaming shield, but\\ncould not wound his body, for Neptune stood guard over the son of\\nNestor, though the darts fell thickly round him. He was never clear of\\nthe foe, but was always in the thick of the fight; his spear was never\\nidle; he poised and aimed it in every direction, so eager was he to hit\\nsomeone from a distance or to fight him hand to hand.\\n\\nAs he was thus aiming among the crowd, he was seen by Adamas, son of\\nAsius, who rushed towards him and struck him with a spear in the middle\\nof his shield, but Neptune made its point without effect, for he\\ngrudged him the life of Antilochus. One half, therefore, of the spear\\nstuck fast like a charred stake in Antilochus\\'s shield, while the other\\nlay on the ground. Adamas then sought shelter under cover of his men,\\nbut Meriones followed after and hit him with a spear midway between the\\nprivate parts and the navel, where a wound is particularly painful to\\nwretched mortals. There did Meriones transfix him, and he writhed\\nconvulsively about the spear as some bull whom mountain herdsmen have\\nbound with ropes of withes and are taking away perforce. Even so did he\\nmove convulsively for a while, but not for very long, till Meriones\\ncame up and drew the spear out of his body, and his eyes were veiled in\\ndarkness.\\n\\nHelenus then struck Deipyrus with a great Thracian sword, hitting him\\non the temple in close combat and tearing the helmet from his head; the\\nhelmet fell to the ground, and one of those who were fighting on the\\nAchaean side took charge of it as it rolled at his feet, but the eyes\\nof Deipyrus were closed in the darkness of death.\\n\\nOn this Menelaus was grieved, and made menacingly towards Helenus,\\nbrandishing his spear; but Helenus drew his bow, and the two attacked\\none another at one and the same moment, the one with his spear, and the\\nother with his bow and arrow. The son of Priam hit the breastplate of\\nMenelaus\\'s corslet, but the arrow glanced from off it. As black beans\\nor pulse come pattering down on to a threshing-floor from the broad\\nwinnowing-shovel, blown by shrill winds and shaken by the shovel--even\\nso did the arrow glance off and recoil from the shield of Menelaus, who\\nin his turn wounded the hand with which Helenus carried his bow; the\\nspear went right through his hand and stuck in the bow itself, so that\\nto his life he retreated under cover of his men, with his hand dragging\\nby his side--for the spear weighed it down till Agenor drew it out and\\nbound the hand carefully up in a woollen sling which his esquire had\\nwith him.\\n\\nPisander then made straight at Menelaus--his evil destiny luring him on\\nto his doom, for he was to fall in fight with you, O Menelaus. When the\\ntwo were hard by one another the spear of the son of Atreus turned\\naside and he missed his aim; Pisander then struck the shield of brave\\nMenelaus but could not pierce it, for the shield stayed the spear and\\nbroke the shaft; nevertheless he was glad and made sure of victory;\\nforthwith, however, the son of Atreus drew his sword and sprang upon\\nhim. Pisander then seized the bronze battle-axe, with its long and\\npolished handle of olive wood that hung by his side under his shield,\\nand the two made at one another. Pisander struck the peak of Menelaus\\'s\\ncrested helmet just under the crest itself, and Menelaus hit Pisander\\nas he was coming towards him, on the forehead, just at the rise of his\\nnose; the bones cracked and his two gore-bedrabbled eyes fell by his\\nfeet in the dust. He fell backwards to the ground, and Menelaus set his\\nheel upon him, stripped him of his armour, and vaunted over him saying,\\n\"Even thus shall you Trojans leave the ships of the Achaeans, proud and\\ninsatiate of battle though you be, nor shall you lack any of the\\ndisgrace and shame which you have heaped upon myself. Cowardly\\nshe-wolves that you are, you feared not the anger of dread Jove,\\navenger of violated hospitality, who will one day destroy your city;\\nyou stole my wedded wife and wickedly carried off much treasure when\\nyou were her guest, and now you would fling fire upon our ships, and\\nkill our heroes. A day will come when, rage as you may, you shall be\\nstayed. O father Jove, you, who they say art above all, both gods and\\nmen, in wisdom, and from whom all things that befall us do proceed, how\\ncan you thus favour the Trojans--men so proud and overweening, that\\nthey are never tired of fighting? All things pall after a while--sleep,\\nlove, sweet song, and stately dance--still these are things of which a\\nman would surely have his fill rather than of battle, whereas it is of\\nbattle that the Trojans are insatiate.\"\\n\\nSo saying Menelaus stripped the blood-stained armour from the body of\\nPisander, and handed it over to his men; then he again ranged himself\\namong those who were in the front of the fight.\\n\\nHarpalion son of King Pylaemenes then sprang upon him; he had come to\\nfight at Troy along with his father, but he did not go home again. He\\nstruck the middle of Menelaus\\'s shield with his spear but could not\\npierce it, and to save his life drew back under cover of his men,\\nlooking round him on every side lest he should be wounded. But Meriones\\naimed a bronze-tipped arrow at him as he was leaving the field, and hit\\nhim on the right buttock; the arrow pierced the bone through and\\nthrough, and penetrated the bladder, so he sat down where he was and\\nbreathed his last in the arms of his comrades, stretched like a worm\\nupon the ground and watering the earth with the blood that flowed from\\nhis wound. The brave Paphlagonians tended him with all due care; they\\nraised him into his chariot, and bore him sadly off to the city of\\nTroy; his father went also with him weeping bitterly, but there was no\\nransom that could bring his dead son to life again.\\n\\nParis was deeply grieved by the death of Harpalion, who was his host\\nwhen he went among the Paphlagonians; he aimed an arrow, therefore, in\\norder to avenge him. Now there was a certain man named Euchenor, son of\\nPolyidus the prophet, a brave man and wealthy, whose home was in\\nCorinth. This Euchenor had set sail for Troy well knowing that it would\\nbe the death of him, for his good old father Polyidus had often told\\nhim that he must either stay at home and die of a terrible disease, or\\ngo with the Achaeans and perish at the hands of the Trojans; he chose,\\ntherefore, to avoid incurring the heavy fine the Achaeans would have\\nlaid upon him, and at the same time to escape the pain and suffering of\\ndisease. Paris now smote him on the jaw under his ear, whereon the life\\nwent out of him and he was enshrouded in the darkness of death.\\n\\nThus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. But Hector had not\\nyet heard, and did not know that the Argives were making havoc of his\\nmen on the left wing of the battle, where the Achaeans ere long would\\nhave triumphed over them, so vigorously did Neptune cheer them on and\\nhelp them. He therefore held on at the point where he had first forced\\nhis way through the gates and the wall, after breaking through the\\nserried ranks of Danaan warriors. It was here that the ships of Ajax\\nand Protesilaus were drawn up by the sea-shore; here the wall was at\\nits lowest, and the fight both of man and horse raged most fiercely.\\nThe Boeotians and the Ionians with their long tunics, the Locrians, the\\nmen of Phthia, and the famous force of the Epeans could hardly stay\\nHector as he rushed on towards the ships, nor could they drive him from\\nthem, for he was as a wall of fire. The chosen men of the Athenians\\nwere in the van, led by Menestheus son of Peteos, with whom were also\\nPheidas, Stichius, and stalwart Bias; Meges son of Phyleus, Amphion,\\nand Dracius commanded the Epeans, while Medon and staunch Podarces led\\nthe men of Phthia. Of these, Medon was bastard son to Oileus and\\nbrother of Ajax, but he lived in Phylace away from his own country, for\\nhe had killed the brother of his stepmother Eriopis, the wife of\\nOileus; the other, Podarces, was the son of Iphiclus, son of Phylacus.\\nThese two stood in the van of the Phthians, and defended the ships\\nalong with the Boeotians.\\n\\nAjax son of Oileus, never for a moment left the side of Ajax, son of\\nTelamon, but as two swart oxen both strain their utmost at the plough\\nwhich they are drawing in a fallow field, and the sweat steams upwards\\nfrom about the roots of their horns--nothing but the yoke divides them\\nas they break up the ground till they reach the end of the field--even\\nso did the two Ajaxes stand shoulder to shoulder by one another. Many\\nand brave comrades followed the son of Telamon, to relieve him of his\\nshield when he was overcome with sweat and toil, but the Locrians did\\nnot follow so close after the son of Oileus, for they could not hold\\ntheir own in a hand-to-hand fight. They had no bronze helmets with\\nplumes of horse-hair, neither had they shields nor ashen spears, but\\nthey had come to Troy armed with bows, and with slings of twisted wool\\nfrom which they showered their missiles to break the ranks of the\\nTrojans. The others, therefore, with their heavy armour bore the brunt\\nof the fight with the Trojans and with Hector, while the Locrians shot\\nfrom behind, under their cover; and thus the Trojans began to lose\\nheart, for the arrows threw them into confusion.\\n\\nThe Trojans would now have been driven in sorry plight from the ships\\nand tents back to windy Ilius, had not Polydamas presently said to\\nHector, \"Hector, there is no persuading you to take advice. Because\\nheaven has so richly endowed you with the arts of war, you think that\\nyou must therefore excel others in counsel; but you cannot thus claim\\npreeminence in all things. Heaven has made one man an excellent\\nsoldier; of another it has made a dancer or a singer and player on the\\nlyre; while yet in another Jove has implanted a wise understanding of\\nwhich men reap fruit to the saving of many, and he himself knows more\\nabout it than any one; therefore I will say what I think will be best.\\nThe fight has hemmed you in as with a circle of fire, and even now that\\nthe Trojans are within the wall some of them stand aloof in full\\narmour, while others are fighting scattered and outnumbered near the\\nships. Draw back, therefore, and call your chieftains round you, that\\nwe may advise together whether to fall now upon the ships in the hope\\nthat heaven may vouchsafe us victory, or to beat a retreat while we can\\nyet safely do so. I greatly fear that the Achaeans will pay us their\\ndebt of yesterday in full, for there is one abiding at their ships who\\nis never weary of battle, and who will not hold aloof much longer.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Polydamas, and his words pleased Hector well. He sprang in\\nfull armour from his chariot and said, \"Polydamas, gather the\\nchieftains here; I will go yonder into the fight, but will return at\\nonce when I have given them their orders.\"\\n\\nHe then sped onward, towering like a snowy mountain, and with a loud\\ncry flew through the ranks of the Trojans and their allies. When they\\nheard his voice they all hastened to gather round Polydamas, the\\nexcellent son of Panthous, but Hector kept on among the foremost,\\nlooking everywhere to find Deiphobus and prince Helenus, Adamas son of\\nAsius, and Asius son of Hyrtacus; living, indeed, and scatheless he\\ncould no longer find them, for the two last were lying by the sterns of\\nthe Achaean ships, slain by the Argives, while the others had been also\\nstricken and wounded by them; but upon the left wing of the dread\\nbattle he found Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen, cheering his men\\nand urging them on to fight. He went up to him and upbraided him.\\n\"Paris,\" said he, \"evil-hearted Paris, fair to see but woman-mad and\\nfalse of tongue, where are Deiphobus and King Helenus? Where are Adamas\\nson of Asius, and Asius son of Hyrtacus? Where too is Othryoneus? Ilius\\nis undone and will now surely fall!\"\\n\\nAlexandrus answered, \"Hector, why find fault when there is no one to\\nfind fault with? I should hold aloof from battle on any day rather than\\nthis, for my mother bore me with nothing of the coward about me. From\\nthe moment when you set our men fighting about the ships we have been\\nstaying here and doing battle with the Danaans. Our comrades about whom\\nyou ask me are dead; Deiphobus and King Helenus alone have left the\\nfield, wounded both of them in the hand, but the son of Saturn saved\\nthem alive. Now, therefore, lead on where you would have us go, and we\\nwill follow with right goodwill; you shall not find us fail you in so\\nfar as our strength holds out, but no man can do more than in him lies,\\nno matter how willing he may be.\"\\n\\nWith these words he satisfied his brother, and the two went towards the\\npart of the battle where the fight was thickest, about Cebriones, brave\\nPolydamas, Phalces, Orthaeus, godlike Polyphetes, Palmys, Ascanius, and\\nMorys son of Hippotion, who had come from fertile Ascania on the\\npreceding day to relieve other troops. Then Jove urged them on to\\nfight. They flew forth like the blasts of some fierce wind that strike\\nearth in the van of a thunderstorm--they buffet the salt sea into an\\nuproar; many and mighty are the great waves that come crashing in one\\nafter the other upon the shore with their arching heads all crested\\nwith foam--even so did rank behind rank of Trojans arrayed in gleaming\\narmour follow their leaders onward. The way was led by Hector son of\\nPriam, peer of murderous Mars, with his round shield before him--his\\nshield of ox-hides covered with plates of bronze--and his gleaming\\nhelmet upon his temples. He kept stepping forward under cover of his\\nshield in every direction, making trial of the ranks to see if they\\nwould give way before him, but he could not daunt the courage of the\\nAchaeans. Ajax was the first to stride out and challenge him. \"Sir,\" he\\ncried, \"draw near; why do you think thus vainly to dismay the Argives?\\nWe Achaeans are excellent soldiers, but the scourge of Jove has fallen\\nheavily upon us. Your heart, forsooth, is set on destroying our ships,\\nbut we too have hands that can keep you at bay, and your own fair town\\nshall be sooner taken and sacked by ourselves. The time is near when\\nyou shall pray Jove and all the gods in your flight, that your steeds\\nmay be swifter than hawks as they raise the dust on the plain and bear\\nyou back to your city.\"\\n\\nAs he was thus speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand, and the\\nhost of the Achaeans shouted, for they took heart at the omen. But\\nHector answered, \"Ajax, braggart and false of tongue, would that I were\\nas sure of being son for evermore to aegis-bearing Jove, with Queen\\nJuno for my mother, and of being held in like honour with Minerva and\\nApollo, as I am that this day is big with the destruction of the\\nAchaeans; and you shall fall among them if you dare abide my spear; it\\nshall rend your fair body and bid you glut our hounds and birds of prey\\nwith your fat and your flesh, as you fall by the ships of the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nWith these words he led the way and the others followed after with a\\ncry that rent the air, while the host shouted behind them. The Argives\\non their part raised a shout likewise, nor did they forget their\\nprowess, but stood firm against the onslaught of the Trojan chieftains,\\nand the cry from both the hosts rose up to heaven and to the brightness\\nof Jove\\'s presence.',\n",
       " 'BOOK XXIII\\n\\n  The funeral of Patroclus, and the funeral games.\\n\\nThus did they make their moan throughout the city, while the Achaeans\\nwhen they reached the Hellespont went back every man to his own ship.\\nBut Achilles would not let the Myrmidons go, and spoke to his brave\\ncomrades saying, \"Myrmidons, famed horsemen and my own trusted friends,\\nnot yet, forsooth, let us unyoke, but with horse and chariot draw near\\nto the body and mourn Patroclus, in due honour to the dead. When we\\nhave had full comfort of lamentation we will unyoke our horses and take\\nsupper all of us here.\"\\n\\nOn this they all joined in a cry of wailing and Achilles led them in\\ntheir lament. Thrice did they drive their chariots all sorrowing round\\nthe body, and Thetis stirred within them a still deeper yearning. The\\nsands of the seashore and the men\\'s armour were wet with their weeping,\\nso great a minister of fear was he whom they had lost. Chief in all\\ntheir mourning was the son of Peleus: he laid his bloodstained hand on\\nthe breast of his friend. \"Fare well,\" he cried, \"Patroclus, even in\\nthe house of Hades. I will now do all that I erewhile promised you; I\\nwill drag Hector hither and let dogs devour him raw; twelve noble sons\\nof Trojans will I also slay before your pyre to avenge you.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he treated the body of noble Hector with contumely, laying\\nit at full length in the dust beside the bier of Patroclus. The others\\nthen put off every man his armour, took the horses from their chariots,\\nand seated themselves in great multitude by the ship of the fleet\\ndescendant of Aeacus, who thereon feasted them with an abundant funeral\\nbanquet. Many a goodly ox, with many a sheep and bleating goat did they\\nbutcher and cut up; many a tusked boar moreover, fat and well-fed, did\\nthey singe and set to roast in the flames of Vulcan; and rivulets of\\nblood flowed all round the place where the body was lying.\\n\\nThen the princes of the Achaeans took the son of Peleus to Agamemnon,\\nbut hardly could they persuade him to come with them, so wroth was he\\nfor the death of his comrade. As soon as they reached Agamemnon\\'s tent\\nthey told the serving-men to set a large tripod over the fire in case\\nthey might persuade the son of Peleus to wash the clotted gore from\\nthis body, but he denied them sternly, and swore it with a solemn oath,\\nsaying, \"Nay, by King Jove, first and mightiest of all gods, it is not\\nmeet that water should touch my body, till I have laid Patroclus on the\\nflames, have built him a barrow, and shaved my head--for so long as I\\nlive no such second sorrow shall ever draw nigh me. Now, therefore, let\\nus do all that this sad festival demands, but at break of day, King\\nAgamemnon, bid your men bring wood, and provide all else that the dead\\nmay duly take into the realm of darkness; the fire shall thus burn him\\nout of our sight the sooner, and the people shall turn again to their\\nown labours.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They made haste to\\nprepare the meal, they ate, and every man had his full share so that\\nall were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,\\nthe others went to their rest each in his own tent, but the son of\\nPeleus lay grieving among his Myrmidons by the shore of the sounding\\nsea, in an open place where the waves came surging in one after\\nanother. Here a very deep slumber took hold upon him and eased the\\nburden of his sorrows, for his limbs were weary with chasing Hector\\nround windy Ilius. Presently the sad spirit of Patroclus drew near him,\\nlike what he had been in stature, voice, and the light of his beaming\\neyes, clad, too, as he had been clad in life. The spirit hovered over\\nhis head and said--\\n\\n\"You sleep, Achilles, and have forgotten me; you loved me living, but\\nnow that I am dead you think for me no further. Bury me with all speed\\nthat I may pass the gates of Hades; the ghosts, vain shadows of men\\nthat can labour no more, drive me away from them; they will not yet\\nsuffer me to join those that are beyond the river, and I wander all\\ndesolate by the wide gates of the house of Hades. Give me now your hand\\nI pray you, for when you have once given me my dues of fire, never\\nshall I again come forth out of the house of Hades. Nevermore shall we\\nsit apart and take sweet counsel among the living; the cruel fate which\\nwas my birth-right has yawned its wide jaws around me--nay, you too\\nAchilles, peer of gods, are doomed to die beneath the wall of the noble\\nTrojans.\\n\\n\"One prayer more will I make you, if you will grant it; let not my\\nbones be laid apart from yours, Achilles, but with them; even as we\\nwere brought up together in your own home, what time Menoetius brought\\nme to you as a child from Opoeis because by a sad spite I had killed\\nthe son of Amphidamas--not of set purpose, but in childish quarrel over\\nthe dice. The knight Peleus took me into his house, entreated me\\nkindly, and named me to be your squire; therefore let our bones lie in\\nbut a single urn, the two-handled golden vase given to you by your\\nmother.\"\\n\\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Why, true heart, are you come hither to lay\\nthese charges upon me? I will of my own self do all as you have bidden\\nme. Draw closer to me, let us once more throw our arms around one\\nanother, and find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows.\"\\n\\nHe opened his arms towards him as he spoke and would have clasped him\\nin them, but there was nothing, and the spirit vanished as a vapour,\\ngibbering and whining into the earth. Achilles sprang to his feet,\\nsmote his two hands, and made lamentation saying, \"Of a truth even in\\nthe house of Hades there are ghosts and phantoms that have no life in\\nthem; all night long the sad spirit of Patroclus has hovered over head\\nmaking piteous moan, telling me what I am to do for him, and looking\\nwondrously like himself.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak and his words set them all weeping and mourning about\\nthe poor dumb dead, till rosy-fingered morn appeared. Then King\\nAgamemnon sent men and mules from all parts of the camp, to bring wood,\\nand Meriones, squire to Idomeneus, was in charge over them. They went\\nout with woodmen\\'s axes and strong ropes in their hands, and before\\nthem went the mules. Up hill and down dale did they go, by straight\\nways and crooked, and when they reached the heights of many-fountained\\nIda, they laid their axes to the roots of many a tall branching oak\\nthat came thundering down as they felled it. They split the trees and\\nbound them behind the mules, which then wended their way as they best\\ncould through the thick brushwood on to the plain. All who had been\\ncutting wood bore logs, for so Meriones squire to Idomeneus had bidden\\nthem, and they threw them down in a line upon the seashore at the place\\nwhere Achilles would make a mighty monument for Patroclus and for\\nhimself.\\n\\nWhen they had thrown down their great logs of wood over the whole\\nground, they stayed all of them where they were, but Achilles ordered\\nhis brave Myrmidons to gird on their armour, and to yoke each man his\\nhorses; they therefore rose, girded on their armour and mounted each\\nhis chariot--they and their charioteers with them. The chariots went\\nbefore, and they that were on foot followed as a cloud in their tens of\\nthousands after. In the midst of them his comrades bore Patroclus and\\ncovered him with the locks of their hair which they cut off and threw\\nupon his body. Last came Achilles with his head bowed for sorrow, so\\nnoble a comrade was he taking to the house of Hades.\\n\\nWhen they came to the place of which Achilles had told them they laid\\nthe body down and built up the wood. Achilles then bethought him of\\nanother matter. He went a space away from the pyre, and cut off the\\nyellow lock which he had let grow for the river Spercheius. He looked\\nall sorrowfully out upon the dark sea, and said, \"Spercheius, in vain\\ndid my father Peleus vow to you that when I returned home to my loved\\nnative land I should cut off this lock and offer you a holy hecatomb;\\nfifty she-goats was I to sacrifice to you there at your springs, where\\nis your grove and your altar fragrant with burnt-offerings. Thus did my\\nfather vow, but you have not fulfilled his prayer; now, therefore, that\\nI shall see my home no more, I give this lock as a keepsake to the hero\\nPatroclus.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he placed the lock in the hands of his dear comrade, and\\nall who stood by were filled with yearning and lamentation. The sun\\nwould have gone down upon their mourning had not Achilles presently\\nsaid to Agamemnon, \"Son of Atreus, for it is to you that the people\\nwill give ear, there is a time to mourn and a time to cease from\\nmourning; bid the people now leave the pyre and set about getting their\\ndinners: we, to whom the dead is dearest, will see to what is wanted\\nhere, and let the other princes also stay by me.\"\\n\\nWhen King Agamemnon heard this he dismissed the people to their ships,\\nbut those who were about the dead heaped up wood and built a pyre a\\nhundred feet this way and that; then they laid the dead all sorrowfully\\nupon the top of it. They flayed and dressed many fat sheep and oxen\\nbefore the pyre, and Achilles took fat from all of them and wrapped the\\nbody therein from head to foot, heaping the flayed carcases all round\\nit. Against the bier he leaned two-handled jars of honey and unguents;\\nfour proud horses did he then cast upon the pyre, groaning the while he\\ndid so. The dead hero had had house-dogs; two of them did Achilles slay\\nand threw upon the pyre; he also put twelve brave sons of noble Trojans\\nto the sword and laid them with the rest, for he was full of bitterness\\nand fury. Then he committed all to the resistless and devouring might\\nof the fire; he groaned aloud and called on his dead comrade by name.\\n\"Fare well,\" he cried, \"Patroclus, even in the house of Hades; I am now\\ndoing all that I have promised you. Twelve brave sons of noble Trojans\\nshall the flames consume along with yourself, but dogs, not fire, shall\\ndevour the flesh of Hector son of Priam.\"\\n\\nThus did he vaunt, but the dogs came not about the body of Hector, for\\nJove\\'s daughter Venus kept them off him night and day, and anointed him\\nwith ambrosial oil of roses that his flesh might not be torn when\\nAchilles was dragging him about. Phoebus Apollo moreover sent a dark\\ncloud from heaven to earth, which gave shade to the whole place where\\nHector lay, that the heat of the sun might not parch his body.\\n\\nNow the pyre about dead Patroclus would not kindle. Achilles therefore\\nbethought him of another matter; he went apart and prayed to the two\\nwinds Boreas and Zephyrus vowing them goodly offerings. He made them\\nmany drink-offerings from the golden cup and besought them to come and\\nhelp him that the wood might make haste to kindle and the dead bodies\\nbe consumed. Fleet Iris heard him praying and started off to fetch the\\nwinds. They were holding high feast in the house of boisterous Zephyrus\\nwhen Iris came running up to the stone threshold of the house and stood\\nthere, but as soon as they set eyes on her they all came towards her\\nand each of them called her to him, but Iris would not sit down. \"I\\ncannot stay,\" she said, \"I must go back to the streams of Oceanus and\\nthe land of the Ethiopians who are offering hecatombs to the immortals,\\nand I would have my share; but Achilles prays that Boreas and shrill\\nZephyrus will come to him, and he vows them goodly offerings; he would\\nhave you blow upon the pyre of Patroclus for whom all the Achaeans are\\nlamenting.\"\\n\\nWith this she left them, and the two winds rose with a cry that rent\\nthe air and swept the clouds before them. They blew on and on until\\nthey came to the sea, and the waves rose high beneath them, but when\\nthey reached Troy they fell upon the pyre till the mighty flames roared\\nunder the blast that they blew. All night long did they blow hard and\\nbeat upon the fire, and all night long did Achilles grasp his double\\ncup, drawing wine from a mixing-bowl of gold, and calling upon the\\nspirit of dead Patroclus as he poured it upon the ground until the\\nearth was drenched. As a father mourns when he is burning the bones of\\nhis bridegroom son whose death has wrung the hearts of his parents,\\neven so did Achilles mourn while burning the body of his comrade,\\npacing round the bier with piteous groaning and lamentation.\\n\\nAt length as the Morning Star was beginning to herald the light which\\nsaffron-mantled Dawn was soon to suffuse over the sea, the flames fell\\nand the fire began to die. The winds then went home beyond the Thracian\\nsea, which roared and boiled as they swept over it. The son of Peleus\\nnow turned away from the pyre and lay down, overcome with toil, till he\\nfell into a sweet slumber. Presently they who were about the son of\\nAtreus drew near in a body, and roused him with the noise and tramp of\\ntheir coming. He sat upright and said, \"Son of Atreus, and all other\\nprinces of the Achaeans, first pour red wine everywhere upon the fire\\nand quench it; let us then gather the bones of Patroclus son of\\nMenoetius, singling them out with care; they are easily found, for they\\nlie in the middle of the pyre, while all else, both men and horses, has\\nbeen thrown in a heap and burned at the outer edge. We will lay the\\nbones in a golden urn, in two layers of fat, against the time when I\\nshall myself go down into the house of Hades. As for the barrow, labour\\nnot to raise a great one now, but such as is reasonable. Afterwards,\\nlet those Achaeans who may be left at the ships when I am gone, build\\nit both broad and high.\"\\n\\nThus he spoke and they obeyed the word of the son of Peleus. First they\\npoured red wine upon the thick layer of ashes and quenched the fire.\\nWith many tears they singled out the whitened bones of their loved\\ncomrade and laid them within a golden urn in two layers of fat: they\\nthen covered the urn with a linen cloth and took it inside the tent.\\nThey marked off the circle where the barrow should be, made a\\nfoundation for it about the pyre, and forthwith heaped up the earth.\\nWhen they had thus raised a mound they were going away, but Achilles\\nstayed the people and made them sit in assembly. He brought prizes from\\nthe ships--cauldrons, tripods, horses and mules, noble oxen, women with\\nfair girdles, and swart iron.\\n\\nThe first prize he offered was for the chariot races--a woman skilled\\nin all useful arts, and a three-legged cauldron that had ears for\\nhandles, and would hold twenty-two measures. This was for the man who\\ncame in first. For the second there was a six-year old mare, unbroken,\\nand in foal to a he-ass; the third was to have a goodly cauldron that\\nhad never yet been on the fire; it was still bright as when it left the\\nmaker, and would hold four measures. The fourth prize was two talents\\nof gold, and the fifth a two-handled urn as yet unsoiled by smoke. Then\\nhe stood up and spoke among the Argives saying--\\n\\n\"Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, these are the prizes that lie\\nwaiting the winners of the chariot races. At any other time I should\\ncarry off the first prize and take it to my own tent; you know how far\\nmy steeds excel all others--for they are immortal; Neptune gave them to\\nmy father Peleus, who in his turn gave them to myself; but I shall hold\\naloof, I and my steeds that have lost their brave and kind driver, who\\nmany a time has washed them in clear water and anointed their manes\\nwith oil. See how they stand weeping here, with their manes trailing on\\nthe ground in the extremity of their sorrow. But do you others set\\nyourselves in order throughout the host, whosoever has confidence in\\nhis horses and in the strength of his chariot.\"\\n\\nThus spoke the son of Peleus and the drivers of chariots bestirred\\nthemselves. First among them all uprose Eumelus, king of men, son of\\nAdmetus, a man excellent in horsemanship. Next to him rose mighty\\nDiomed son of Tydeus; he yoked the Trojan horses which he had taken\\nfrom Aeneas, when Apollo bore him out of the fight. Next to him,\\nyellow-haired Menelaus son of Atreus rose and yoked his fleet horses,\\nAgamemnon\\'s mare Aethe, and his own horse Podargus. The mare had been\\ngiven to Agamemnon by Echepolus son of Anchises, that he might not have\\nto follow him to Ilius, but might stay at home and take his ease; for\\nJove had endowed him with great wealth and he lived in spacious Sicyon.\\nThis mare, all eager for the race, did Menelaus put under the yoke.\\n\\nFourth in order Antilochus, son to noble Nestor son of Neleus, made\\nready his horses. These were bred in Pylos, and his father came up to\\nhim to give him good advice of which, however, he stood in but little\\nneed. \"Antilochus,\" said Nestor, \"you are young, but Jove and Neptune\\nhave loved you well, and have made you an excellent horseman. I need\\nnot therefore say much by way of instruction. You are skilful at\\nwheeling your horses round the post, but the horses themselves are very\\nslow, and it is this that will, I fear, mar your chances. The other\\ndrivers know less than you do, but their horses are fleeter; therefore,\\nmy dear son, see if you cannot hit upon some artifice whereby you may\\ninsure that the prize shall not slip through your fingers. The woodman\\ndoes more by skill than by brute force; by skill the pilot guides his\\nstorm-tossed barque over the sea, and so by skill one driver can beat\\nanother. If a man go wide in rounding this way and that, whereas a man\\nwho knows what he is doing may have worse horses, but he will keep them\\nwell in hand when he sees the doubling-post; he knows the precise\\nmoment at which to pull the rein, and keeps his eye well on the man in\\nfront of him. I will give you this certain token which cannot escape\\nyour notice. There is a stump of a dead tree--oak or pine as it may\\nbe--some six feet above the ground, and not yet rotted away by rain; it\\nstands at the fork of the road; it has two white stones set one on each\\nside, and there is a clear course all round it. It may have been a\\nmonument to some one long since dead, or it may have been used as a\\ndoubling-post in days gone by; now, however, it has been fixed on by\\nAchilles as the mark round which the chariots shall turn; hug it as\\nclose as you can, but as you stand in your chariot lean over a little\\nto the left; urge on your right-hand horse with voice and lash, and\\ngive him a loose rein, but let the left-hand horse keep so close in,\\nthat the nave of your wheel shall almost graze the post; but mind the\\nstone, or you will wound your horses and break your chariot in pieces,\\nwhich would be sport for others but confusion for yourself. Therefore,\\nmy dear son, mind well what you are about, for if you can be first to\\nround the post there is no chance of any one giving you the go-by\\nlater, not even though you had Adrestus\\'s horse Arion behind you--a\\nhorse which is of divine race--or those of Laomedon, which are the\\nnoblest in this country.\"\\n\\nWhen Nestor had made an end of counselling his son he sat down in his\\nplace, and fifth in order Meriones got ready his horses. They then all\\nmounted their chariots and cast lots. Achilles shook the helmet, and\\nthe lot of Antilochus son of Nestor fell out first; next came that of\\nKing Eumelus, and after his, those of Menelaus son of Atreus and of\\nMeriones. The last place fell to the lot of Diomed son of Tydeus, who\\nwas the best man of them all. They took their places in line; Achilles\\nshowed them the doubling-post round which they were to turn, some way\\noff upon the plain; here he stationed his father\\'s follower Phoenix as\\numpire, to note the running, and report truly.\\n\\nAt the same instant they all of them lashed their horses, struck them\\nwith the reins, and shouted at them with all their might. They flew\\nfull speed over the plain away from the ships, the dust rose from under\\nthem as it were a cloud or whirlwind, and their manes were all flying\\nin the wind. At one moment the chariots seemed to touch the ground, and\\nthen again they bounded into the air; the drivers stood erect, and\\ntheir hearts beat fast and furious in their lust of victory. Each kept\\ncalling on his horses, and the horses scoured the plain amid the clouds\\nof dust that they raised.\\n\\nIt was when they were doing the last part of the course on their way\\nback towards the sea that their pace was strained to the utmost and it\\nwas seen what each could do. The horses of the descendant of Pheres now\\ntook the lead, and close behind them came the Trojan stallions of\\nDiomed. They seemed as if about to mount Eumelus\\'s chariot, and he\\ncould feel their warm breath on his back and on his broad shoulders,\\nfor their heads were close to him as they flew over the course. Diomed\\nwould have now passed him, or there would have been a dead heat, but\\nPhoebus Apollo to spite him made him drop his whip. Tears of anger fell\\nfrom his eyes as he saw the mares going on faster than ever, while his\\nown horses lost ground through his having no whip. Minerva saw the\\ntrick which Apollo had played the son of Tydeus, so she brought him his\\nwhip and put spirit into his horses; moreover she went after the son of\\nAdmetus in a rage and broke his yoke for him; the mares went one to one\\nside of the course, and the other to the other, and the pole was broken\\nagainst the ground. Eumelus was thrown from his chariot close to the\\nwheel; his elbows, mouth, and nostrils were all torn, and his forehead\\nwas bruised above his eyebrows; his eyes filled with tears and he could\\nfind no utterance. But the son of Tydeus turned his horses aside and\\nshot far ahead, for Minerva put fresh strength into them and covered\\nDiomed himself with glory.\\n\\nMenelaus son of Atreus came next behind him, but Antilochus called to\\nhis father\\'s horses. \"On with you both,\" he cried, \"and do your very\\nutmost. I do not bid you try to beat the steeds of the son of Tydeus,\\nfor Minerva has put running into them, and has covered Diomed with\\nglory; but you must overtake the horses of the son of Atreus and not be\\nleft behind, or Aethe who is so fleet will taunt you. Why, my good\\nfellows, are you lagging? I tell you, and it shall surely be--Nestor\\nwill keep neither of you, but will put both of you to the sword, if we\\nwin any the worse a prize through your carelessness. Fly after them at\\nyour utmost speed; I will hit on a plan for passing them in a narrow\\npart of the way, and it shall not fail me.\"\\n\\nThey feared the rebuke of their master, and for a short space went\\nquicker. Presently Antilochus saw a narrow place where the road had\\nsunk. The ground was broken, for the winter\\'s rain had gathered and had\\nworn the road so that the whole place was deepened. Menelaus was making\\ntowards it so as to get there first, for fear of a foul, but Antilochus\\nturned his horses out of the way, and followed him a little on one\\nside. The son of Atreus was afraid and shouted out, \"Antilochus, you\\nare driving recklessly; rein in your horses; the road is too narrow\\nhere, it will be wider soon, and you can pass me then; if you foul my\\nchariot you may bring both of us to a mischief.\"\\n\\nBut Antilochus plied his whip, and drove faster, as though he had not\\nheard him. They went side by side for about as far as a young man can\\nhurl a disc from his shoulder when he is trying his strength, and then\\nMenelaus\\'s mares drew behind, for he left off driving for fear the\\nhorses should foul one another and upset the chariots; thus, while\\npressing on in quest of victory, they might both come headlong to the\\nground. Menelaus then upbraided Antilochus and said, \"There is no\\ngreater trickster living than you are; go, and bad luck go with you;\\nthe Achaeans say not well that you have understanding, and come what\\nmay you shall not bear away the prize without sworn protest on my part.\"\\n\\nThen he called on his horses and said to them, \"Keep your pace, and\\nslacken not; the limbs of the other horses will weary sooner than\\nyours, for they are neither of them young.\"\\n\\nThe horses feared the rebuke of their master, and went faster, so that\\nthey were soon nearly up with the others.\\n\\nMeanwhile the Achaeans from their seats were watching how the horses\\nwent, as they scoured the plain amid clouds of their own dust.\\nIdomeneus captain of the Cretans was first to make out the running, for\\nhe was not in the thick of the crowd, but stood on the most commanding\\npart of the ground. The driver was a long way off, but Idomeneus could\\nhear him shouting, and could see the foremost horse quite plainly--a\\nchestnut with a round white star, like the moon, on its forehead. He\\nstood up and said among the Argives, \"My friends, princes and\\ncounsellors of the Argives, can you see the running as well as I can?\\nThere seems to be another pair in front now, and another driver; those\\nthat led off at the start must have been disabled out on the plain. I\\nsaw them at first making their way round the doubling-post, but now,\\nthough I search the plain of Troy, I cannot find them. Perhaps the\\nreins fell from the driver\\'s hand so that he lost command of his horses\\nat the doubling-post, and could not turn it. I suppose he must have\\nbeen thrown out there, and broken his chariot, while his mares have\\nleft the course and gone off wildly in a panic. Come up and see for\\nyourselves, I cannot make out for certain, but the driver seems an\\nAetolian by descent, ruler over the Argives, brave Diomed the son of\\nTydeus.\"\\n\\nAjax the son of Oileus took him up rudely and said, \"Idomeneus, why\\nshould you be in such a hurry to tell us all about it, when the mares\\nare still so far out upon the plain? You are none of the youngest, nor\\nyour eyes none of the sharpest, but you are always laying down the law.\\nYou have no right to do so, for there are better men here than you are.\\nEumelus\\'s horses are in front now, as they always have been, and he is\\non the chariot holding the reins.\"\\n\\nThe captain of the Cretans was angry, and answered, \"Ajax you are an\\nexcellent railer, but you have no judgement, and are wanting in much\\nelse as well, for you have a vile temper. I will wager you a tripod or\\ncauldron, and Agamemnon son of Atreus shall decide whose horses are\\nfirst. You will then know to your cost.\"\\n\\nAjax son of Oileus was for making him an angry answer, and there would\\nhave been yet further brawling between them, had not Achilles risen in\\nhis place and said, \"Cease your railing, Ajax and Idomeneus; it is not\\nseemly; you would be scandalised if you saw any one else do the like:\\nsit down and keep your eyes on the horses; they are speeding towards\\nthe winning-post and will be here directly. You will then both of you\\nknow whose horses are first, and whose come after.\"\\n\\nAs he was speaking, the son of Tydeus came driving in, plying his whip\\nlustily from his shoulder, and his horses stepping high as they flew\\nover the course. The sand and grit rained thick on the driver, and the\\nchariot inlaid with gold and tin ran close behind his fleet horses.\\nThere was little trace of wheel-marks in the fine dust, and the horses\\ncame flying in at their utmost speed. Diomed stayed them in the middle\\nof the crowd, and the sweat from their manes and chests fell in streams\\non to the ground. Forthwith he sprang from his goodly chariot, and\\nleaned his whip against his horses\\' yoke; brave Sthenelus now lost no\\ntime, but at once brought on the prize, and gave the woman and the\\near-handled cauldron to his comrades to take away. Then he unyoked the\\nhorses.\\n\\nNext after him came in Antilochus of the race of Neleus, who had passed\\nMenelaus by a trick and not by the fleetness of his horses; but even so\\nMenelaus came in as close behind him as the wheel is to the horse that\\ndraws both the chariot and its master. The end hairs of a horse\\'s tail\\ntouch the tyre of the wheel, and there is never much space between\\nwheel and horse when the chariot is going; Menelaus was no further than\\nthis behind Antilochus, though at first he had been a full disc\\'s throw\\nbehind him. He had soon caught him up again, for Agamemnon\\'s mare Aethe\\nkept pulling stronger and stronger, so that if the course had been\\nlonger he would have passed him, and there would not even have been a\\ndead heat. Idomeneus\\'s brave squire Meriones was about a spear\\'s cast\\nbehind Menelaus. His horses were slowest of all, and he was the worst\\ndriver. Last of them all came the son of Admetus, dragging his chariot\\nand driving his horses on in front. When Achilles saw him he was sorry,\\nand stood up among the Argives saying, \"The best man is coming in last.\\nLet us give him a prize for it is reasonable. He shall have the second,\\nbut the first must go to the son of Tydeus.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak and the others all of them applauded his saying, and\\nwere for doing as he had said, but Nestor\\'s son Antilochus stood up and\\nclaimed his rights from the son of Peleus. \"Achilles,\" said he, \"I\\nshall take it much amiss if you do this thing; you would rob me of my\\nprize, because you think Eumelus\\'s chariot and horses were thrown out,\\nand himself too, good man that he is. He should have prayed duly to the\\nimmortals; he would not have come in last if he had done so. If you are\\nsorry for him and so choose, you have much gold in your tents, with\\nbronze, sheep, cattle and horses. Take something from this store if you\\nwould have the Achaeans speak well of you, and give him a better prize\\neven than that which you have now offered; but I will not give up the\\nmare, and he that will fight me for her, let him come on.\"\\n\\nAchilles smiled as he heard this, and was pleased with Antilochus, who\\nwas one of his dearest comrades. So he said--\\n\\n\"Antilochus, if you would have me find Eumelus another prize, I will\\ngive him the bronze breastplate with a rim of tin running all round it\\nwhich I took from Asteropaeus. It will be worth much money to him.\"\\n\\nHe bade his comrade Automedon bring the breastplate from his tent, and\\nhe did so. Achilles then gave it over to Eumelus, who received it\\ngladly.\\n\\nBut Menelaus got up in a rage, furiously angry with Antilochus. An\\nattendant placed his staff in his hands and bade the Argives keep\\nsilence: the hero then addressed them. \"Antilochus,\" said he, \"what is\\nthis from you who have been so far blameless? You have made me cut a\\npoor figure and baulked my horses by flinging your own in front of\\nthem, though yours are much worse than mine are; therefore, O princes\\nand counsellors of the Argives, judge between us and show no favour,\\nlest one of the Achaeans say, \\'Menelaus has got the mare through lying\\nand corruption; his horses were far inferior to Antilochus\\'s, but he\\nhas greater weight and influence.\\' Nay, I will determine the matter\\nmyself, and no man will blame me, for I shall do what is just. Come\\nhere, Antilochus, and stand, as our custom is, whip in hand before your\\nchariot and horses; lay your hand on your steeds, and swear by\\nearth-encircling Neptune that you did not purposely and guilefully get\\nin the way of my horses.\"\\n\\nAnd Antilochus answered, \"Forgive me; I am much younger, King Menelaus,\\nthan you are; you stand higher than I do and are the better man of the\\ntwo; you know how easily young men are betrayed into indiscretion;\\ntheir tempers are more hasty and they have less judgement; make due\\nallowances therefore, and bear with me; I will of my own accord give up\\nthe mare that I have won, and if you claim any further chattel from my\\nown possessions, I would rather yield it to you, at once, than fall\\nfrom your good graces henceforth, and do wrong in the sight of heaven.\"\\n\\nThe son of Nestor then took the mare and gave her over to Menelaus,\\nwhose anger was thus appeased; as when dew falls upon a field of\\nripening corn, and the lands are bristling with the harvest--even so, O\\nMenelaus, was your heart made glad within you. He turned to Antilochus\\nand said, \"Now, Antilochus, angry though I have been, I can give way to\\nyou of my own free will; you have never been headstrong nor\\nill-disposed hitherto, but this time your youth has got the better of\\nyour judgement; be careful how you outwit your betters in future; no\\none else could have brought me round so easily, but your good father,\\nyour brother, and yourself have all of you had infinite trouble on my\\nbehalf; I therefore yield to your entreaty, and will give up the mare\\nto you, mine though it indeed be; the people will thus see that I am\\nneither harsh nor vindictive.\"\\n\\nWith this he gave the mare over to Antilochus\\'s comrade Noemon, and\\nthen took the cauldron. Meriones, who had come in fourth, carried off\\nthe two talents of gold, and the fifth prize, the two-handled urn,\\nbeing unawarded, Achilles gave it to Nestor, going up to him among the\\nassembled Argives and saying, \"Take this, my good old friend, as an\\nheirloom and memorial of the funeral of Patroclus--for you shall see\\nhim no more among the Argives. I give you this prize though you cannot\\nwin one; you can now neither wrestle nor fight, and cannot enter for\\nthe javelin-match nor foot-races, for the hand of age has been laid\\nheavily upon you.\"\\n\\nSo saying he gave the urn over to Nestor, who received it gladly and\\nanswered, \"My son, all that you have said is true; there is no strength\\nnow in my legs and feet, nor can I hit out with my hands from either\\nshoulder. Would that I were still young and strong as when the Epeans\\nwere burying King Amarynceus in Buprasium, and his sons offered prizes\\nin his honour. There was then none that could vie with me neither of\\nthe Epeans nor the Pylians themselves nor the Aetolians. In boxing I\\novercame Clytomedes son of Enops, and in wrestling, Ancaeus of Pleuron\\nwho had come forward against me. Iphiclus was a good runner, but I beat\\nhim, and threw farther with my spear than either Phyleus or Polydorus.\\nIn chariot-racing alone did the two sons of Actor surpass me by\\ncrowding their horses in front of me, for they were angry at the way\\nvictory had gone, and at the greater part of the prizes remaining in\\nthe place in which they had been offered. They were twins, and the one\\nkept on holding the reins, and holding the reins, while the other plied\\nthe whip. Such was I then, but now I must leave these matters to\\nyounger men; I must bow before the weight of years, but in those days I\\nwas eminent among heroes. And now, sir, go on with the funeral contests\\nin honour of your comrade: gladly do I accept this urn, and my heart\\nrejoices that you do not forget me but are ever mindful of my goodwill\\ntowards you, and of the respect due to me from the Achaeans. For all\\nwhich may the grace of heaven be vouchsafed you in great abundance.\"\\n\\nThereon the son of Peleus, when he had listened to all the thanks of\\nNestor, went about among the concourse of the Achaeans, and presently\\noffered prizes for skill in the painful art of boxing. He brought out a\\nstrong mule, and made it fast in the middle of the crowd--a she-mule\\nnever yet broken, but six years old--when it is hardest of all to break\\nthem: this was for the victor, and for the vanquished he offered a\\ndouble cup. Then he stood up and said among the Argives, \"Son of\\nAtreus, and all other Achaeans, I invite our two champion boxers to lay\\nabout them lustily and compete for these prizes. He to whom Apollo\\nvouchsafes the greater endurance, and whom the Achaeans acknowledge as\\nvictor, shall take the mule back with him to his own tent, while he\\nthat is vanquished shall have the double cup.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke there stood up a champion both brave and of great stature,\\na skilful boxer, Epeus, son of Panopeus. He laid his hand on the mule\\nand said, \"Let the man who is to have the cup come hither, for none but\\nmyself will take the mule. I am the best boxer of all here present, and\\nnone can beat me. Is it not enough that I should fall short of you in\\nactual fighting? Still, no man can be good at everything. I tell you\\nplainly, and it shall come true; if any man will box with me I will\\nbruise his body and break his bones; therefore let his friends stay\\nhere in a body and be at hand to take him away when I have done with\\nhim.\"\\n\\nThey all held their peace, and no man rose save Euryalus son of\\nMecisteus, who was son of Talaus. Mecisteus went once to Thebes after\\nthe fall of Oedipus, to attend his funeral, and he beat all the people\\nof Cadmus. The son of Tydeus was Euryalus\\'s second, cheering him on and\\nhoping heartily that he would win. First he put a waistband round him\\nand then he gave him some well-cut thongs of ox-hide; the two men being\\nnow girt went into the middle of the ring, and immediately fell to;\\nheavily indeed did they punish one another and lay about them with\\ntheir brawny fists. One could hear the horrid crashing of their jaws,\\nand they sweated from every pore of their skin. Presently Epeus came on\\nand gave Euryalus a blow on the jaw as he was looking round; Euryalus\\ncould not keep his legs; they gave way under him in a moment and he\\nsprang up with a bound, as a fish leaps into the air near some shore\\nthat is all bestrewn with sea-wrack, when Boreas furs the top of the\\nwaves, and then falls back into deep water. But noble Epeus caught hold\\nof him and raised him up; his comrades also came round him and led him\\nfrom the ring, unsteady in his gait, his head hanging on one side, and\\nspitting great clots of gore. They set him down in a swoon and then\\nwent to fetch the double cup.\\n\\nThe son of Peleus now brought out the prizes for the third contest and\\nshowed them to the Argives. These were for the painful art of\\nwrestling. For the winner there was a great tripod ready for setting\\nupon the fire, and the Achaeans valued it among themselves at twelve\\noxen. For the loser he brought out a woman skilled in all manner of\\narts, and they valued her at four oxen. He rose and said among the\\nArgives, \"Stand forward, you who will essay this contest.\"\\n\\nForthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, and crafty Ulysses,\\nfull of wiles, rose also. The two girded themselves and went into the\\nmiddle of the ring. They gripped each other in their strong hands like\\nthe rafters which some master-builder frames for the roof of a high\\nhouse to keep the wind out. Their backbones cracked as they tugged at\\none another with their mighty arms--and sweat rained from them in\\ntorrents. Many a bloody weal sprang up on their sides and shoulders,\\nbut they kept on striving with might and main for victory and to win\\nthe tripod. Ulysses could not throw Ajax, nor Ajax him; Ulysses was too\\nstrong for him; but when the Achaeans began to tire of watching them,\\nAjax said to Ulysses, \"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall either\\nlift me, or I you, and let Jove settle it between us.\"\\n\\nHe lifted him from the ground as he spoke, but Ulysses did not forget\\nhis cunning. He hit Ajax in the hollow at back of his knee, so that he\\ncould not keep his feet, but fell on his back with Ulysses lying upon\\nhis chest, and all who saw it marvelled. Then Ulysses in turn lifted\\nAjax and stirred him a little from the ground but could not lift him\\nright off it, his knee sank under him, and the two fell side by side on\\nthe ground and were all begrimed with dust. They now sprang towards one\\nanother and were for wrestling yet a third time, but Achilles rose and\\nstayed them. \"Put not each other further,\" said he, \"to such cruel\\nsuffering; the victory is with both alike, take each of you an equal\\nprize, and let the other Achaeans now compete.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak and they did even as he had said, and put on their\\nshirts again after wiping the dust from off their bodies.\\n\\nThe son of Peleus then offered prizes for speed in running--a\\nmixing-bowl beautifully wrought, of pure silver. It would hold six\\nmeasures, and far exceeded all others in the whole world for beauty; it\\nwas the work of cunning artificers in Sidon, and had been brought into\\nport by Phoenicians from beyond the sea, who had made a present of it\\nto Thoas. Eueneus son of Jason had given it to Patroclus in ransom of\\nPriam\\'s son Lycaon, and Achilles now offered it as a prize in honour of\\nhis comrade to him who should be the swiftest runner. For the second\\nprize he offered a large ox, well fattened, while for the last there\\nwas to be half a talent of gold. He then rose and said among the\\nArgives, \"Stand forward, you who will essay this contest.\"\\n\\nForthwith uprose fleet Ajax son of Oileus, with cunning Ulysses, and\\nNestor\\'s son Antilochus, the fastest runner among all the youth of his\\ntime. They stood side by side and Achilles showed them the goal. The\\ncourse was set out for them from the starting-post, and the son of\\nOileus took the lead at once, with Ulysses as close behind him as the\\nshuttle is to a woman\\'s bosom when she throws the woof across the warp\\nand holds it close up to her; even so close behind him was\\nUlysses--treading in his footprints before the dust could settle there,\\nand Ajax could feel his breath on the back of his head as he ran\\nswiftly on. The Achaeans all shouted applause as they saw him straining\\nhis utmost, and cheered him as he shot past them; but when they were\\nnow nearing the end of the course Ulysses prayed inwardly to Minerva.\\n\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"and help my feet, O goddess.\" Thus did he pray,\\nand Pallas Minerva heard his prayer; she made his hands and his feet\\nfeel light, and when the runners were at the point of pouncing upon the\\nprize, Ajax, through Minerva\\'s spite slipped upon some offal that was\\nlying there from the cattle which Achilles had slaughtered in honour of\\nPatroclus, and his mouth and nostrils were all filled with cow dung.\\nUlysses therefore carried off the mixing-bowl, for he got before Ajax\\nand came in first. But Ajax took the ox and stood with his hand on one\\nof its horns, spitting the dung out of his mouth. Then he said to the\\nArgives, \"Alas, the goddess has spoiled my running; she watches over\\nUlysses and stands by him as though she were his own mother.\" Thus did\\nhe speak and they all of them laughed heartily.\\n\\nAntilochus carried off the last prize and smiled as he said to the\\nbystanders, \"You all see, my friends, that now too the gods have shown\\ntheir respect for seniority. Ajax is somewhat older than I am, and as\\nfor Ulysses, he belongs to an earlier generation, but he is hale in\\nspite of his years, and no man of the Achaeans can run against him save\\nonly Achilles.\"\\n\\nHe said this to pay a compliment to the son of Peleus, and Achilles\\nanswered, \"Antilochus, you shall not have praised me to no purpose; I\\nshall give you an additional half talent of gold.\" He then gave the\\nhalf talent to Antilochus, who received it gladly.\\n\\nThen the son of Peleus brought out the spear, helmet and shield that\\nhad been borne by Sarpedon, and were taken from him by Patroclus. He\\nstood up and said among the Argives, \"We bid two champions put on their\\narmour, take their keen blades, and make trial of one another in the\\npresence of the multitude; whichever of them can first wound the flesh\\nof the other, cut through his armour, and draw blood, to him will I\\ngive this goodly Thracian sword inlaid with silver, which I took from\\nAsteropaeus, but the armour let both hold in partnership, and I will\\ngive each of them a hearty meal in my own tent.\"\\n\\nForthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, as also mighty Diomed\\nson of Tydeus. When they had put on their armour each on his own side\\nof the ring, they both went into the middle eager to engage, and with\\nfire flashing from their eyes. The Achaeans marvelled as they beheld\\nthem, and when the two were now close up with one another, thrice did\\nthey spring forward and thrice try to strike each other in close\\ncombat. Ajax pierced Diomed\\'s round shield, but did not draw blood, for\\nthe cuirass beneath the shield protected him; thereon the son of Tydeus\\nfrom over his huge shield kept aiming continually at Ajax\\'s neck with\\nthe point of his spear, and the Achaeans alarmed for his safety bade\\nthem leave off fighting and divide the prize between them. Achilles\\nthen gave the great sword to the son of Tydeus, with its scabbard, and\\nthe leathern belt with which to hang it.\\n\\nAchilles next offered the massive iron quoit which mighty Eetion had\\nerewhile been used to hurl, until Achilles had slain him and carried it\\noff in his ships along with other spoils. He stood up and said among\\nthe Argives, \"Stand forward, you who would essay this contest. He who\\nwins it will have a store of iron that will last him five years as they\\ngo rolling round, and if his fair fields lie far from a town his\\nshepherd or ploughman will not have to make a journey to buy iron, for\\nhe will have a stock of it on his own premises.\"\\n\\nThen uprose the two mighty men Polypoetes and Leonteus, with Ajax son\\nof Telamon and noble Epeus. They stood up one after the other and Epeus\\ntook the quoit, whirled it, and flung it from him, which set all the\\nAchaeans laughing. After him threw Leonteus of the race of Mars. Ajax\\nson of Telamon threw third, and sent the quoit beyond any mark that had\\nbeen made yet, but when mighty Polypoetes took the quoit he hurled it\\nas though it had been a stockman\\'s stick which he sends flying about\\namong his cattle when he is driving them, so far did his throw\\nout-distance those of the others. All who saw it roared applause, and\\nhis comrades carried the prize for him and set it on board his ship.\\n\\nAchilles next offered a prize of iron for archery--ten double-edged\\naxes and ten with single edges: he set up a ship\\'s mast, some way off\\nupon the sands, and with a fine string tied a pigeon to it by the foot;\\nthis was what they were to aim at. \"Whoever,\" he said, \"can hit the\\npigeon shall have all the axes and take them away with him; he who hits\\nthe string without hitting the bird will have taken a worse aim and\\nshall have the single-edged axes.\"\\n\\nThen uprose King Teucer, and Meriones the stalwart squire of Idomeneus\\nrose also, They cast lots in a bronze helmet and the lot of Teucer fell\\nfirst. He let fly with his arrow forthwith, but he did not promise\\nhecatombs of firstling lambs to King Apollo, and missed his bird, for\\nApollo foiled his aim; but he hit the string with which the bird was\\ntied, near its foot; the arrow cut the string clean through so that it\\nhung down towards the ground, while the bird flew up into the sky, and\\nthe Achaeans shouted applause. Meriones, who had his arrow ready while\\nTeucer was aiming, snatched the bow out of his hand, and at once\\npromised that he would sacrifice a hecatomb of firstling lambs to\\nApollo lord of the bow; then espying the pigeon high up under the\\nclouds, he hit her in the middle of the wing as she was circling\\nupwards; the arrow went clean through the wing and fixed itself in the\\nground at Meriones\\' feet, but the bird perched on the ship\\'s mast\\nhanging her head and with all her feathers drooping; the life went out\\nof her, and she fell heavily from the mast. Meriones, therefore, took\\nall ten double-edged axes, while Teucer bore off the single-edged ones\\nto his ships.\\n\\nThen the son of Peleus brought in a spear and a cauldron that had never\\nbeen on the fire; it was worth an ox, and was chased with a pattern of\\nflowers; and those that throw the javelin stood up--to wit the son of\\nAtreus, king of men Agamemnon, and Meriones, stalwart squire of\\nIdomeneus. But Achilles spoke saying, \"Son of Atreus, we know how far\\nyou excel all others both in power and in throwing the javelin; take\\nthe cauldron back with you to your ships, but if it so please you, let\\nus give the spear to Meriones; this at least is what I should myself\\nwish.\"\\n\\nKing Agamemnon assented. So he gave the bronze spear to Meriones, and\\nhanded the goodly cauldron to Talthybius his esquire.']"

       "['Book XVII\\n\\nTELEMACHUS AND HIS MOTHER MEET--ULYSSES AND EUMAEUS COME DOWN TO THE\\nTOWN, AND ULYSSES IS INSULTED BY MELANTHIUS--HE IS RECOGNISED BY THE\\nDOG ARGOS--HE IS INSULTED AND PRESENTLY STRUCK BY ANTINOUS WITH A\\nSTOOL--PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.\\n\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus\\nbound on his sandals and took a strong spear that suited his hands, for\\nhe wanted to go into the city. \"Old friend,\" said he to the swineherd,\\n\"I will now go to the town and show myself to my mother, for she will\\nnever leave off grieving till she has seen me. As for this unfortunate\\nstranger, take him to the town and let him beg there of any one who will\\ngive him a drink and a piece of bread. I have trouble enough of my own,\\nand cannot be burdened with other people. If this makes him angry so\\nmuch the worse for him, but I like to say what I mean.\"\\n\\nThen Ulysses said, \"Sir, I do not want to stay here; a beggar can always\\ndo better in town than country, for any one who likes can give him\\nsomething. I am too old to care about remaining here at the beck and\\ncall of a master. Therefore let this man do as you have just told him,\\nand take me to the town as soon as I have had a warm by the fire, and\\nthe day has got a little heat in it. My clothes are wretchedly thin, and\\nthis frosty morning I shall be perished with cold, for you say the city\\nis some way off.\"\\n\\nOn this Telemachus strode off through the yards, brooding his revenge\\nupon the suitors. When he reached home he stood his spear against a\\nbearing-post of the cloister, crossed the stone floor of the cloister\\nitself, and went inside.\\n\\nNurse Euryclea saw him long before any one else did. She was putting the\\nfleeces on to the seats, and she burst out crying as she ran up to him;\\nall the other maids came up too, and covered his head and shoulders with\\ntheir kisses. Penelope came out of her room looking like Diana or Venus,\\nand wept as she flung her arms about her son. She kissed his forehead\\nand both his beautiful eyes, \"Light of my eyes,\" she cried as she spoke\\nfondly to him, \"so you are come home again; I made sure I was never\\ngoing to see you any more. To think of your having gone off to Pylos\\nwithout saying anything about it or obtaining my consent. But come, tell\\nme what you saw.\"\\n\\n\"Do not scold me, mother,\" answered Telemachus, \"nor vex me, seeing what\\na narrow escape I have had, but wash your face, change your dress, go\\nupstairs with your maids, and promise full and sufficient hecatombs to\\nall the gods if Jove will only grant us our revenge upon the suitors. I\\nmust now go to the place of assembly to invite a stranger who has come\\nback with me from Pylos. I sent him on with my crew, and told Piraeus to\\ntake him home and look after him till I could come for him myself.\"\\n\\nShe heeded her son\\'s words, washed her face, changed her dress, and\\nvowed full and sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if they would only\\nvouchsafe her revenge upon the suitors.\\n\\nTelemachus went through, and out of, the cloisters spear in hand--not\\nalone, for his two fleet dogs went with him. Minerva endowed him with a\\npresence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as he went\\nby, and the suitors gathered round him with fair words in their mouths\\nand malice in their hearts; but he avoided them, and went to sit with\\nMentor, Antiphus, and Halitherses, old friends of his father\\'s house,\\nand they made him tell them all that had happened to him. Then Piraeus\\ncame up with Theoclymenus, whom he had escorted through the town to the\\nplace of assembly, whereon Telemachus at once joined them. Piraeus was\\nfirst to speak: \"Telemachus,\" said he, \"I wish you would send some of\\nyour women to my house to take away the presents Menelaus gave you.\"\\n\\n\"We do not know, Piraeus,\" answered Telemachus, \"what may happen. If\\nthe suitors kill me in my own house and divide my property among them,\\nI would rather you had the presents than that any of those people should\\nget hold of them. If on the other hand I managed to kill them, I shall\\nbe much obliged if you will kindly bring me my presents.\"\\n\\nWith these words he took Theoclymenus to his own house. When they got\\nthere they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats, went into the\\nbaths, and washed themselves. When the maids had washed and anointed\\nthem, and had given them cloaks and shirts, they took their seats at\\ntable. A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden\\newer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands;\\nand she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them\\nbread and offered them many good things of what there was in the\\nhouse. Opposite them sat Penelope, reclining on a couch by one of the\\nbearing-posts of the cloister, and spinning. Then they laid their hands\\non the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had\\nenough to eat and drink Penelope said:\\n\\n\"Telemachus, I shall go upstairs and lie down on that sad couch, which I\\nhave not ceased to water with my tears, from the day Ulysses set out for\\nTroy with the sons of Atreus. You failed, however, to make it clear to\\nme before the suitors came back to the house, whether or no you had been\\nable to hear anything about the return of your father.\"\\n\\n\"I will tell you then truth,\" replied her son. \"We went to Pylos and saw\\nNestor, who took me to his house and treated me as hospitably as though\\nI were a son of his own who had just returned after a long absence; so\\nalso did his sons; but he said he had not heard a word from any\\nhuman being about Ulysses, whether he was alive or dead. He sent me,\\ntherefore, with a chariot and horses to Menelaus. There I saw Helen, for\\nwhose sake so many, both Argives and Trojans, were in heaven\\'s wisdom\\ndoomed to suffer. Menelaus asked me what it was that had brought me to\\nLacedaemon, and I told him the whole truth, whereon he said, \\'So, then,\\nthese cowards would usurp a brave man\\'s bed? A hind might as well lay\\nher new-born young in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed in the\\nforest or in some grassy dell. The lion, when he comes back to his lair,\\nwill make short work with the pair of them, and so will Ulysses with\\nthese suitors. By father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still\\nthe man that he was when he wrestled with Philomeleides in Lesbos, and\\nthrew him so heavily that all the Greeks cheered him--if he is still\\nsuch, and were to come near these suitors, they would have a short\\nshrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your question, however, I will\\nnot prevaricate nor deceive you, but what the old man of the sea told\\nme, so much will I tell you in full. He said he could see Ulysses on\\nan island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph Calypso, who was\\nkeeping him prisoner, and he could not reach his home, for he had no\\nships nor sailors to take him over the sea.\\' This was what Menelaus told\\nme, and when I had heard his story I came away; the gods then gave me a\\nfair wind and soon brought me safe home again.\"\\n\\nWith these words he moved the heart of Penelope. Then Theoclymenus said\\nto her:\\n\\n\"Madam, wife of Ulysses, Telemachus does not understand these things;\\nlisten therefore to me, for I can divine them surely, and will hide\\nnothing from you. May Jove the king of heaven be my witness, and the\\nrites of hospitality, with that hearth of Ulysses to which I now come,\\nthat Ulysses himself is even now in Ithaca, and, either going about the\\ncountry or staying in one place, is enquiring into all these evil deeds\\nand preparing a day of reckoning for the suitors. I saw an omen when I\\nwas on the ship which meant this, and I told Telemachus about it.\"\\n\\n\"May it be even so,\" answered Penelope; \"if your words come true, you\\nshall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see you\\nshall congratulate you.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs, or\\naiming with spears at a mark on the levelled ground in front of the\\nhouse, and behaving with all their old insolence. But when it was now\\ntime for dinner, and the flock of sheep and goats had come into the town\\nfrom all the country round, {140} with their shepherds as usual, then\\nMedon, who was their favourite servant, and who waited upon them at\\ntable, said, \"Now then, my young masters, you have had enough sport, so\\ncome inside that we may get dinner ready. Dinner is not a bad thing, at\\ndinner time.\"\\n\\nThey left their sports as he told them, and when they were within the\\nhouse, they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats inside, and then\\nsacrificed some sheep, goats, pigs, and a heifer, all of them fat and\\nwell grown. {141} Thus they made ready for their meal. In the meantime\\nUlysses and the swineherd were about starting for the town, and the\\nswineherd said, \"Stranger, I suppose you still want to go to town\\nto-day, as my master said you were to do; for my own part I should have\\nliked you to stay here as a station hand, but I must do as my master\\ntells me, or he will scold me later on, and a scolding from one\\'s master\\nis a very serious thing. Let us then be off, for it is now broad day; it\\nwill be night again directly and then you will find it colder.\" {142}\\n\\n\"I know, and understand you,\" replied Ulysses; \"you need say no more.\\nLet us be going, but if you have a stick ready cut, let me have it to\\nwalk with, for you say the road is a very rough one.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he threw his shabby old tattered wallet over his shoulders,\\nby the cord from which it hung, and Eumaeus gave him a stick to his\\nliking. The two then started, leaving the station in charge of the dogs\\nand herdsmen who remained behind; the swineherd led the way and his\\nmaster followed after, looking like some broken down old tramp as he\\nleaned upon his staff, and his clothes were all in rags. When they had\\ngot over the rough steep ground and were nearing the city, they reached\\nthe fountain from which the citizens drew their water. This had\\nbeen made by Ithacus, Neritus, and Polyctor. There was a grove of\\nwater-loving poplars planted in a circle all round it, and the clear\\ncold water came down to it from a rock high up, {143} while above the\\nfountain there was an altar to the nymphs, at which all wayfarers used\\nto sacrifice. Here Melanthius son of Dolius overtook them as he was\\ndriving down some goats, the best in his flock, for the suitors\\' dinner,\\nand there were two shepherds with him. When he saw Eumaeus and Ulysses\\nhe reviled them with outrageous and unseemly language, which made\\nUlysses very angry.\\n\\n\"There you go,\" cried he, \"and a precious pair you are. See how heaven\\nbrings birds of the same feather to one another. Where, pray, master\\nswineherd, are you taking this poor miserable object? It would make any\\none sick to see such a creature at table. A fellow like this never won a\\nprize for anything in his life, but will go about rubbing his shoulders\\nagainst every man\\'s door post, and begging, not for swords and cauldrons\\n{144} like a man, but only for a few scraps not worth begging for. If\\nyou would give him to me for a hand on my station, he might do to clean\\nout the folds, or bring a bit of sweet feed to the kids, and he could\\nfatten his thighs as much as he pleased on whey; but he has taken to bad\\nways and will not go about any kind of work; he will do nothing but\\nbeg victuals all the town over, to feed his insatiable belly. I say,\\ntherefore--and it shall surely be--if he goes near Ulysses\\' house he\\nwill get his head broken by the stools they will fling at him, till they\\nturn him out.\"\\n\\nOn this, as he passed, he gave Ulysses a kick on the hip out of pure\\nwantonness, but Ulysses stood firm, and did not budge from the path. For\\na moment he doubted whether or no to fly at Melanthius and kill him\\nwith his staff, or fling him to the ground and beat his brains out;\\nhe resolved, however, to endure it and keep himself in check, but the\\nswineherd looked straight at Melanthius and rebuked him, lifting up his\\nhands and praying to heaven as he did so.\\n\\n\"Fountain nymphs,\" he cried, \"children of Jove, if ever Ulysses burned\\nyou thigh bones covered with fat whether of lambs or kids, grant my\\nprayer that heaven may send him home. He would soon put an end to\\nthe swaggering threats with which such men as you go about insulting\\npeople--gadding all over the town while your flocks are going to ruin\\nthrough bad shepherding.\"\\n\\nThen Melanthius the goatherd answered, \"You ill conditioned cur, what\\nare you talking about? Some day or other I will put you on board ship\\nand take you to a foreign country, where I can sell you and pocket the\\nmoney you will fetch. I wish I were as sure that Apollo would strike\\nTelemachus dead this very day, or that the suitors would kill him, as I\\nam that Ulysses will never come home again.\"\\n\\nWith this he left them to come on at their leisure, while he went\\nquickly forward and soon reached the house of his master. When he\\ngot there he went in and took his seat among the suitors opposite\\nEurymachus, who liked him better than any of the others. The servants\\nbrought him a portion of meat, and an upper woman servant set bread\\nbefore him that he might eat. Presently Ulysses and the swineherd came\\nup to the house and stood by it, amid a sound of music, for Phemius was\\njust beginning to sing to the suitors. Then Ulysses took hold of the\\nswineherd\\'s hand, and said:\\n\\n\"Eumaeus, this house of Ulysses is a very fine place. No matter how far\\nyou go, you will find few like it. One building keeps following on after\\nanother. The outer court has a wall with battlements all round it; the\\ndoors are double folding, and of good workmanship; it would be a hard\\nmatter to take it by force of arms. I perceive, too, that there are many\\npeople banqueting within it, for there is a smell of roast meat, and\\nI hear a sound of music, which the gods have made to go along with\\nfeasting.\"\\n\\nThen Eumaeus said, \"You have perceived aright, as indeed you generally\\ndo; but let us think what will be our best course. Will you go inside\\nfirst and join the suitors, leaving me here behind you, or will you wait\\nhere and let me go in first? But do not wait long, or some one may see\\nyou loitering about outside, and throw something at you. Consider this\\nmatter I pray you.\"\\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"I understand and heed. Go in first and leave\\nme here where I am. I am quite used to being beaten and having things\\nthrown at me. I have been so much buffeted about in war and by sea that\\nI am case-hardened, and this too may go with the rest. But a man cannot\\nhide away the cravings of a hungry belly; this is an enemy which gives\\nmuch trouble to all men; it is because of this that ships are fitted out\\nto sail the seas, and to make war upon other people.\"\\n\\nAs they were thus talking, a dog that had been lying asleep raised his\\nhead and pricked up his ears. This was Argos, whom Ulysses had bred\\nbefore setting out for Troy, but he had never had any work out of him.\\nIn the old days he used to be taken out by the young men when they went\\nhunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that his master was gone\\nhe was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow dung that lay in\\nfront of the stable doors till the men should come and draw it away\\nto manure the great close; and he was full of fleas. As soon as he saw\\nUlysses standing there, he dropped his ears and wagged his tail, but he\\ncould not get close up to his master. When Ulysses saw the dog on the\\nother side of the yard, he dashed a tear from his eyes without Eumaeus\\nseeing it, and said:\\n\\n\"Eumaeus, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap: his\\nbuild is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is he only one\\nof those dogs that come begging about a table, and are kept merely for\\nshow?\"\\n\\n\"This hound,\" answered Eumaeus, \"belonged to him who has died in a far\\ncountry. If he were what he was when Ulysses left for Troy, he would\\nsoon show you what he could do. There was not a wild beast in the forest\\nthat could get away from him when he was once on its tracks. But now he\\nhas fallen on evil times, for his master is dead and gone, and the women\\ntake no care of him. Servants never do their work when their master\\'s\\nhand is no longer over them, for Jove takes half the goodness out of a\\nman when he makes a slave of him.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where the\\nsuitors were, but Argos died as soon as he had recognised his master.\\n\\nTelemachus saw Eumaeus long before any one else did, and beckoned him\\nto come and sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seat lying\\nnear where the carver sat serving out their portions to the suitors; he\\npicked it up, brought it to Telemachus\\'s table, and sat down opposite\\nhim. Then the servant brought him his portion, and gave him bread from\\nthe bread-basket.\\n\\nImmediately afterwards Ulysses came inside, looking like a poor\\nmiserable old beggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in\\nrags. He sat down upon the threshold of ash-wood just inside the doors\\nleading from the outer to the inner court, and against a bearing-post of\\ncypress-wood which the carpenter had skilfully planed, and had made to\\njoin truly with rule and line. Telemachus took a whole loaf from the\\nbread-basket, with as much meat as he could hold in his two hands, and\\nsaid to Eumaeus, \"Take this to the stranger, and tell him to go\\nthe round of the suitors, and beg from them; a beggar must not be\\nshamefaced.\"\\n\\nSo Eumaeus went up to him and said, \"Stranger, Telemachus sends you\\nthis, and says you are to go the round of the suitors begging, for\\nbeggars must not be shamefaced.\"\\n\\nUlysses answered, \"May King Jove grant all happiness to Telemachus, and\\nfulfil the desire of his heart.\"\\n\\nThen with both hands he took what Telemachus had sent him, and laid it\\non the dirty old wallet at his feet. He went on eating it while the\\nbard was singing, and had just finished his dinner as he left off.\\nThe suitors applauded the bard, whereon Minerva went up to Ulysses and\\nprompted him to beg pieces of bread from each one of the suitors, that\\nhe might see what kind of people they were, and tell the good from the\\nbad; but come what might she was not going to save a single one of them.\\nUlysses, therefore, went on his round, going from left to right, and\\nstretched out his hands to beg as though he were a real beggar. Some of\\nthem pitied him, and were curious about him, asking one another who\\nhe was and where he came from; whereon the goatherd Melanthius said,\\n\"Suitors of my noble mistress, I can tell you something about him, for I\\nhave seen him before. The swineherd brought him here, but I know nothing\\nabout the man himself, nor where he comes from.\"\\n\\nOn this Antinous began to abuse the swineherd. \"You precious idiot,\" he\\ncried, \"what have you brought this man to town for? Have we not tramps\\nand beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat? Do you think\\nit a small thing that such people gather here to waste your master\\'s\\nproperty--and must you needs bring this man as well?\"\\n\\nAnd Eumaeus answered, \"Antinous, your birth is good but your words evil.\\nIt was no doing of mine that he came here. Who is likely to invite a\\nstranger from a foreign country, unless it be one of those who can do\\npublic service as a seer, a healer of hurts, a carpenter, or a bard who\\ncan charm us with his singing? Such men are welcome all the world over,\\nbut no one is likely to ask a beggar who will only worry him. You are\\nalways harder on Ulysses\\' servants than any of the other suitors\\nare, and above all on me, but I do not care so long as Telemachus and\\nPenelope are alive and here.\"\\n\\nBut Telemachus said, \"Hush, do not answer him; Antinous has the\\nbitterest tongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse.\"\\n\\nThen turning to Antinous he said, \"Antinous, you take as much care of\\nmy interests as though I were your son. Why should you want to see this\\nstranger turned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take something and give\\nit him yourself; I do not grudge it; I bid you take it. Never mind my\\nmother, nor any of the other servants in the house; but I know you will\\nnot do what I say, for you are more fond of eating things yourself than\\nof giving them to other people.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean, Telemachus,\" replied Antinous, \"by this swaggering\\ntalk? If all the suitors were to give him as much as I will, he would\\nnot come here again for another three months.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet from\\nunder the table, and made as though he would throw it at Ulysses, but\\nthe other suitors all gave him something, and filled his wallet with\\nbread and meat; he was about, therefore, to go back to the threshold and\\neat what the suitors had given him, but he first went up to Antinous and\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"Sir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest man here; you\\nseem to be a chief, foremost among them all; therefore you should be the\\nbetter giver, and I will tell far and wide of your bounty. I too was a\\nrich man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those days I gave to\\nmany a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he might be nor what he\\nwanted. I had any number of servants, and all the other things which\\npeople have who live well and are accounted wealthy, but it pleased Jove\\nto take all away from me. He sent me with a band of roving robbers to\\nEgypt; it was a long voyage and I was undone by it. I stationed my ships\\nin the river Aegyptus, and bade my men stay by them and keep guard\\nover them, while I sent out scouts to reconnoitre from every point of\\nvantage.\\n\\n\"But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged\\nthe land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives and\\nchildren captives. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when they\\nheard the war-cry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain was\\nfilled with soldiers horse and foot, and with the gleam of armour. Then\\nJove spread panic among my men, and they would no longer face the enemy,\\nfor they found themselves surrounded. The Egyptians killed many of us,\\nand took the rest alive to do forced labour for them; as for myself,\\nthey gave me to a friend who met them, to take to Cyprus, Dmetor by\\nname, son of Iasus, who was a great man in Cyprus. Thence I am come\\nhither in a state of great misery.\"\\n\\nThen Antinous said, \"What god can have sent such a pestilence to plague\\nus during our dinner? Get out, into the open part of the court, {145}\\nor I will give you Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence and\\nimportunity; you have begged of all the others, and they have given you\\nlavishly, for they have abundance round them, and it is easy to be free\\nwith other people\\'s property when there is plenty of it.\"\\n\\nOn this Ulysses began to move off, and said, \"Your looks, my fine sir,\\nare better than your breeding; if you were in your own house you would\\nnot spare a poor man so much as a pinch of salt, for though you are in\\nanother man\\'s, and surrounded with abundance, you cannot find it in you\\nto give him even a piece of bread.\"\\n\\nThis made Antinous very angry, and he scowled at him saying, \"You shall\\npay for this before you get clear of the court.\" With these words he\\nthrew a footstool at him, and hit him on the right shoulder blade near\\nthe top of his back. Ulysses stood firm as a rock and the blow did not\\neven stagger him, but he shook his head in silence as he brooded on his\\nrevenge. Then he went back to the threshold and sat down there, laying\\nhis well filled wallet at his feet.\\n\\n\"Listen to me,\" he cried, \"you suitors of Queen Penelope, that I may\\nspeak even as I am minded. A man knows neither ache nor pain if he gets\\nhit while fighting for his money, or for his sheep or his cattle; and\\neven so Antinous has hit me while in the service of my miserable belly,\\nwhich is always getting people into trouble. Still, if the poor have\\ngods and avenging deities at all, I pray them that Antinous may come to\\na bad end before his marriage.\"\\n\\n\"Sit where you are, and eat your victuals in silence, or be off\\nelsewhere,\" shouted Antinous. \"If you say more I will have you dragged\\nhand and foot through the courts, and the servants shall flay you\\nalive.\"\\n\\nThe other suitors were much displeased at this, and one of the young men\\nsaid, \"Antinous, you did ill in striking that poor wretch of a tramp: it\\nwill be worse for you if he should turn out to be some god--and we know\\nthe gods go about disguised in all sorts of ways as people from foreign\\ncountries, and travel about the world to see who do amiss and who\\nrighteously.\" {146}\\n\\nThus said the suitors, but Antinous paid them no heed. Meanwhile\\nTelemachus was furious about the blow that had been given to his father,\\nand though no tear fell from him, he shook his head in silence and\\nbrooded on his revenge.\\n\\nNow when Penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in the\\nbanqueting-cloister, she said before her maids, \"Would that Apollo would\\nso strike you, Antinous,\" and her waiting woman Eurynome answered, \"If\\nour prayers were answered not one of the suitors would ever again see\\nthe sun rise.\" Then Penelope said, \"Nurse, {147} I hate every single one\\nof them, for they mean nothing but mischief, but I hate Antinous like\\nthe darkness of death itself. A poor unfortunate tramp has come begging\\nabout the house for sheer want. Every one else has given him\\nsomething to put in his wallet, but Antinous has hit him on the right\\nshoulder-blade with a footstool.\"\\n\\nThus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room, and in\\nthe meantime Ulysses was getting his dinner. Then she called for the\\nswineherd and said, \"Eumaeus, go and tell the stranger to come here, I\\nwant to see him and ask him some questions. He seems to have travelled\\nmuch, and he may have seen or heard something of my unhappy husband.\"\\n\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"If these Achaeans, Madam,\\nwould only keep quiet, you would be charmed with the history of his\\nadventures. I had him three days and three nights with me in my hut,\\nwhich was the first place he reached after running away from his ship,\\nand he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes. If he had\\nbeen the most heaven-taught minstrel in the whole world, on whose lips\\nall hearers hang entranced, I could not have been more charmed as I\\nsat in my hut and listened to him. He says there is an old friendship\\nbetween his house and that of Ulysses, and that he comes from Crete\\nwhere the descendants of Minos live, after having been driven hither and\\nthither by every kind of misfortune; he also declares that he has heard\\nof Ulysses as being alive and near at hand among the Thesprotians, and\\nthat he is bringing great wealth home with him.\"\\n\\n\"Call him here, then,\" said Penelope, \"that I too may hear his story.\\nAs for the suitors, let them take their pleasure indoors or out as they\\nwill, for they have nothing to fret about. Their corn and wine remain\\nunwasted in their houses with none but servants to consume them, while\\nthey keep hanging about our house day after day sacrificing our oxen,\\nsheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving so much as\\na thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate can stand such\\nrecklessness, for we have now no Ulysses to protect us. If he were to\\ncome again, he and his son would soon have their revenge.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke Telemachus sneezed so loudly that the whole house resounded\\nwith it. Penelope laughed when she heard this, and said to Eumaeus, \"Go\\nand call the stranger; did you not hear how my son sneezed just as I\\nwas speaking? This can only mean that all the suitors are going to be\\nkilled, and that not one of them shall escape. Furthermore I say, and\\nlay my saying to your heart: if I am satisfied that the stranger is\\nspeaking the truth I shall give him a shirt and cloak of good wear.\"\\n\\nWhen Eumaeus heard this he went straight to Ulysses and said, \"Father\\nstranger, my mistress Penelope, mother of Telemachus, has sent for you;\\nshe is in great grief, but she wishes to hear anything you can tell her\\nabout her husband, and if she is satisfied that you are speaking the\\ntruth, she will give you a shirt and cloak, which are the very things\\nthat you are most in want of. As for bread, you can get enough of that\\nto fill your belly, by begging about the town, and letting those give\\nthat will.\"\\n\\n\"I will tell Penelope,\" answered Ulysses, \"nothing but what is strictly\\ntrue. I know all about her husband, and have been partner with him\\nin affliction, but I am afraid of passing through this crowd of cruel\\nsuitors, for their pride and insolence reach heaven. Just now, moreover,\\nas I was going about the house without doing any harm, a man gave me\\na blow that hurt me very much, but neither Telemachus nor any one else\\ndefended me. Tell Penelope, therefore, to be patient and wait till\\nsundown. Let her give me a seat close up to the fire, for my clothes are\\nworn very thin--you know they are, for you have seen them ever since I\\nfirst asked you to help me--she can then ask me about the return of her\\nhusband.\"\\n\\nThe swineherd went back when he heard this, and Penelope said as she saw\\nhim cross the threshold, \"Why do you not bring him here, Eumaeus? Is he\\nafraid that some one will ill-treat him, or is he shy of coming inside\\nthe house at all? Beggars should not be shamefaced.\"\\n\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"The stranger is quite\\nreasonable. He is avoiding the suitors, and is only doing what any one\\nelse would do. He asks you to wait till sundown, and it will be much\\nbetter, madam, that you should have him all to yourself, when you can\\nhear him and talk to him as you will.\"\\n\\n\"The man is no fool,\" answered Penelope, \"it would very likely be as\\nhe says, for there are no such abominable people in the whole world as\\nthese men are.\"\\n\\nWhen she had done speaking Eumaeus went back to the suitors, for he had\\nexplained everything. Then he went up to Telemachus and said in his ear\\nso that none could overhear him, \"My dear sir, I will now go back to the\\npigs, to see after your property and my own business. You will look to\\nwhat is going on here, but above all be careful to keep out of danger,\\nfor there are many who bear you ill will. May Jove bring them to a bad\\nend before they do us a mischief.\"\\n\\n\"Very well,\" replied Telemachus, \"go home when you have had your dinner,\\nand in the morning come here with the victims we are to sacrifice for\\nthe day. Leave the rest to heaven and me.\"\\n\\nOn this Eumaeus took his seat again, and when he had finished his dinner\\nhe left the courts and the cloister with the men at table, and went\\nback to his pigs. As for the suitors, they presently began to amuse\\nthemselves with singing and dancing, for it was now getting on towards\\nevening.',\n",
       " 'BOOK XX\\n\\n  The gods hold a council and determine to watch the fight, from\\n  the hill Callicolone, and the barrow of Hercules--A fight\\n  between Achilles and AEneas is interrupted by Neptune, who\\n  saves AEneas--Achilles kills many Trojans.\\n\\nTHUS, then, did the Achaeans arm by their ships round you, O son of\\nPeleus, who were hungering for battle; while the Trojans over against\\nthem armed upon the rise of the plain.\\n\\nMeanwhile Jove from the top of many-delled Olympus, bade Themis gather\\nthe gods in council, whereon she went about and called them to the\\nhouse of Jove. There was not a river absent except Oceanus, nor a\\nsingle one of the nymphs that haunt fair groves, or springs of rivers\\nand meadows of green grass. When they reached the house of\\ncloud-compelling Jove, they took their seats in the arcades of polished\\nmarble which Vulcan with his consummate skill had made for father Jove.\\n\\nIn such wise, therefore, did they gather in the house of Jove. Neptune\\nalso, lord of the earthquake, obeyed the call of the goddess, and came\\nup out of the sea to join them. There, sitting in the midst of them, he\\nasked what Jove\\'s purpose might be. \"Why,\" said he, \"wielder of the\\nlightning, have you called the gods in council? Are you considering\\nsome matter that concerns the Trojans and Achaeans--for the blaze of\\nbattle is on the point of being kindled between them?\"\\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"You know my purpose, shaker of earth, and wherefore\\nI have called you hither. I take thought for them even in their\\ndestruction. For my own part I shall stay here seated on Mt. Olympus\\nand look on in peace, but do you others go about among Trojans and\\nAchaeans, and help either side as you may be severally disposed. If\\nAchilles fights the Trojans without hindrance they will make no stand\\nagainst him; they have ever trembled at the sight of him, and now that\\nhe is roused to such fury about his comrade, he will override fate\\nitself and storm their city.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Jove and gave the word for war, whereon the gods took their\\nseveral sides and went into battle. Juno, Pallas Minerva,\\nearth-encircling Neptune, Mercury bringer of good luck and excellent in\\nall cunning--all these joined the host that came from the ships; with\\nthem also came Vulcan in all his glory, limping, but yet with his thin\\nlegs plying lustily under him. Mars of gleaming helmet joined the\\nTrojans, and with him Apollo of locks unshorn, and the archer goddess\\nDiana, Leto, Xanthus, and laughter-loving Venus.\\n\\nSo long as the gods held themselves aloof from mortal warriors the\\nAchaeans were triumphant, for Achilles who had long refused to fight\\nwas now with them. There was not a Trojan but his limbs failed him for\\nfear as he beheld the fleet son of Peleus all glorious in his armour,\\nand looking like Mars himself. When, however, the Olympians came to\\ntake their part among men, forthwith uprose strong Strife, rouser of\\nhosts, and Minerva raised her loud voice, now standing by the deep\\ntrench that ran outside the wall, and now shouting with all her might\\nupon the shore of the sounding sea. Mars also bellowed out upon the\\nother side, dark as some black thunder-cloud, and called on the Trojans\\nat the top of his voice, now from the acropolis, and now speeding up\\nthe side of the river Simois till he came to the hill Callicolone.\\n\\nThus did the gods spur on both hosts to fight, and rouse fierce\\ncontention also among themselves. The sire of gods and men thundered\\nfrom heaven above, while from beneath Neptune shook the vast earth, and\\nbade the high hills tremble. The spurs and crests of many-fountained\\nIda quaked, as also the city of the Trojans and the ships of the\\nAchaeans. Hades, king of the realms below, was struck with fear; he\\nsprang panic-stricken from his throne and cried aloud in terror lest\\nNeptune, lord of the earthquake, should crack the ground over his head,\\nand lay bare his mouldy mansions to the sight of mortals and\\nimmortals--mansions so ghastly grim that even the gods shudder to think\\nof them. Such was the uproar as the gods came together in battle.\\nApollo with his arrows took his stand to face King Neptune, while\\nMinerva took hers against the god of war; the archer-goddess Diana with\\nher golden arrows, sister of far-darting Apollo, stood to face Juno;\\nMercury the lusty bringer of good luck faced Leto, while the mighty\\neddying river whom men can Scamander, but gods Xanthus, matched himself\\nagainst Vulcan.\\n\\nThe gods, then, were thus ranged against one another. But the heart of\\nAchilles was set on meeting Hector son of Priam, for it was with his\\nblood that he longed above all things else to glut the stubborn lord of\\nbattle. Meanwhile Apollo set Aeneas on to attack the son of Peleus, and\\nput courage into his heart, speaking with the voice of Lycaon son of\\nPriam. In his likeness therefore, he said to Aeneas, \"Aeneas,\\ncounsellor of the Trojans, where are now the brave words with which you\\nvaunted over your wine before the Trojan princes, saying that you would\\nfight Achilles son of Peleus in single combat?\"\\n\\nAnd Aeneas answered, \"Why do you thus bid me fight the proud son of\\nPeleus, when I am in no mind to do so? Were I to face him now, it would\\nnot be for the first time. His spear has already put me to flight from\\nIda, when he attacked our cattle and sacked Lyrnessus and Pedasus; Jove\\nindeed saved me in that he vouchsafed me strength to fly, else had I\\nfallen by the hands of Achilles and Minerva, who went before him to\\nprotect him and urged him to fall upon the Lelegae and Trojans. No man\\nmay fight Achilles, for one of the gods is always with him as his\\nguardian angel, and even were it not so, his weapon flies ever\\nstraight, and fails not to pierce the flesh of him who is against him;\\nif heaven would let me fight him on even terms he should not soon\\novercome me, though he boasts that he is made of bronze.\"\\n\\nThen said King Apollo, son to Jove, \"Nay, hero, pray to the ever-living\\ngods, for men say that you were born of Jove\\'s daughter Venus, whereas\\nAchilles is son to a goddess of inferior rank. Venus is child to Jove,\\nwhile Thetis is but daughter to the old man of the sea. Bring,\\ntherefore, your spear to bear upon him, and let him not scare you with\\nhis taunts and menaces.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he put courage into the heart of the shepherd of his\\npeople, and he strode in full armour among the ranks of the foremost\\nfighters. Nor did the son of Anchises escape the notice of white-armed\\nJuno, as he went forth into the throng to meet Achilles. She called the\\ngods about her, and said, \"Look to it, you two, Neptune and Minerva,\\nand consider how this shall be; Phoebus Apollo has been sending Aeneas\\nclad in full armour to fight Achilles. Shall we turn him back at once,\\nor shall one of us stand by Achilles and endow him with strength so\\nthat his heart fail not, and he may learn that the chiefs of the\\nimmortals are on his side, while the others who have all along been\\ndefending the Trojans are but vain helpers? Let us all come down from\\nOlympus and join in the fight, that this day he may take no hurt at the\\nhands of the Trojans. Hereafter let him suffer whatever fate may have\\nspun out for him when he was begotten and his mother bore him. If\\nAchilles be not thus assured by the voice of a god, he may come to fear\\npresently when one of us meets him in battle, for the gods are terrible\\nif they are seen face to face.\"\\n\\nNeptune lord of the earthquake answered her saying, \"Juno, restrain\\nyour fury; it is not well; I am not in favour of forcing the other gods\\nto fight us, for the advantage is too greatly on our own side; let us\\ntake our places on some hill out of the beaten track, and let mortals\\nfight it out among themselves. If Mars or Phoebus Apollo begin\\nfighting, or keep Achilles in check so that he cannot fight, we too,\\nwill at once raise the cry of battle, and in that case they will soon\\nleave the field and go back vanquished to Olympus among the other gods.\"\\n\\nWith these words the dark-haired god led the way to the high\\nearth-barrow of Hercules, built round solid masonry, and made by the\\nTrojans and Pallas Minerva for him to fly to when the sea-monster was\\nchasing him from the shore on to the plain. Here Neptune and those that\\nwere with him took their seats, wrapped in a thick cloud of darkness;\\nbut the other gods seated themselves on the brow of Callicolone round\\nyou, O Phoebus, and Mars the waster of cities.\\n\\nThus did the gods sit apart and form their plans, but neither side was\\nwilling to begin battle with the other, and Jove from his seat on high\\nwas in command over them all. Meanwhile the whole plain was alive with\\nmen and horses, and blazing with the gleam of armour. The earth rang\\nagain under the tramp of their feet as they rushed towards each other,\\nand two champions, by far the foremost of them all, met between the\\nhosts to fight--to wit, Aeneas son of Anchises, and noble Achilles.\\n\\nAeneas was first to stride forward in attack, his doughty helmet\\ntossing defiance as he came on. He held his strong shield before his\\nbreast, and brandished his bronze spear. The son of Peleus from the\\nother side sprang forth to meet him, like some fierce lion that the\\nwhole country-side has met to hunt and kill--at first he bodes no ill,\\nbut when some daring youth has struck him with a spear, he crouches\\nopenmouthed, his jaws foam, he roars with fury, he lashes his tail from\\nside to side about his ribs and loins, and glares as he springs\\nstraight before him, to find out whether he is to slay, or be slain\\namong the foremost of his foes--even with such fury did Achilles burn\\nto spring upon Aeneas.\\n\\nWhen they were now close up with one another Achilles was first to\\nspeak. \"Aeneas,\" said he, \"why do you stand thus out before the host to\\nfight me? Is it that you hope to reign over the Trojans in the seat of\\nPriam? Nay, though you kill me Priam will not hand his kingdom over to\\nyou. He is a man of sound judgement, and he has sons of his own. Or\\nhave the Trojans been allotting you a demesne of passing richness, fair\\nwith orchard lawns and corn lands, if you should slay me? This you\\nshall hardly do. I have discomfited you once already. Have you\\nforgotten how when you were alone I chased you from your herds\\nhelter-skelter down the slopes of Ida? You did not turn round to look\\nbehind you; you took refuge in Lyrnessus, but I attacked the city, and\\nwith the help of Minerva and father Jove I sacked it and carried its\\nwomen into captivity, though Jove and the other gods rescued you. You\\nthink they will protect you now, but they will not do so; therefore I\\nsay go back into the host, and do not face me, or you will rue it. Even\\na fool may be wise after the event.\"\\n\\nThen Aeneas answered, \"Son of Peleus, think not that your words can\\nscare me as though I were a child. I too, if I will, can brag and talk\\nunseemly. We know one another\\'s race and parentage as matters of common\\nfame, though neither have you ever seen my parents nor I yours. Men say\\nthat you are son to noble Peleus, and that your mother is Thetis,\\nfair-haired daughter of the sea. I have noble Anchises for my father,\\nand Venus for my mother; the parents of one or other of us shall this\\nday mourn a son, for it will be more than silly talk that shall part us\\nwhen the fight is over. Learn, then, my lineage if you will--and it is\\nknown to many.\\n\\n\"In the beginning Dardanus was the son of Jove, and founded Dardania,\\nfor Ilius was not yet stablished on the plain for men to dwell in, and\\nher people still abode on the spurs of many-fountained Ida. Dardanus\\nhad a son, king Erichthonius, who was wealthiest of all men living; he\\nhad three thousand mares that fed by the water-meadows, they and their\\nfoals with them. Boreas was enamoured of them as they were feeding, and\\ncovered them in the semblance of a dark-maned stallion. Twelve filly\\nfoals did they conceive and bear him, and these, as they sped over the\\nrich plain, would go bounding on over the ripe ears of corn and not\\nbreak them; or again when they would disport themselves on the broad\\nback of Ocean they could gallop on the crest of a breaker. Erichthonius\\nbegat Tros, king of the Trojans, and Tros had three noble sons, Ilus,\\nAssaracus, and Ganymede who was comeliest of mortal men; wherefore the\\ngods carried him off to be Jove\\'s cupbearer, for his beauty\\'s sake,\\nthat he might dwell among the immortals. Ilus begat Laomedon, and\\nLaomedon begat Tithonus, Priam, Lampus, Clytius, and Hiketaon of the\\nstock of Mars. But Assaracus was father to Capys, and Capys to\\nAnchises, who was my father, while Hector is son to Priam.\\n\\n\"Such do I declare my blood and lineage, but as for valour, Jove gives\\nit or takes it as he will, for he is lord of all. And now let there be\\nno more of this prating in mid-battle as though we were children. We\\ncould fling taunts without end at one another; a hundred-oared galley\\nwould not hold them. The tongue can run all whithers and talk all wise;\\nit can go here and there, and as a man says, so shall he be gainsaid.\\nWhat is the use of our bandying hard like women who when they fall foul\\nof one another go out and wrangle in the streets, one half true and the\\nother lies, as rage inspires them? No words of yours shall turn me now\\nthat I am fain to fight--therefore let us make trial of one another\\nwith our spears.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he drove his spear at the great and terrible shield of\\nAchilles, which rang out as the point struck it. The son of Peleus held\\nthe shield before him with his strong hand, and he was afraid, for he\\ndeemed that Aeneas\\'s spear would go through it quite easily, not\\nreflecting that the god\\'s glorious gifts were little likely to yield\\nbefore the blows of mortal men; and indeed Aeneas\\'s spear did not\\npierce the shield, for the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed the\\npoint. It went through two layers, but the god had made the shield in\\nfive, two of bronze, the two innermost ones of tin, and one of gold; it\\nwas in this that the spear was stayed.\\n\\nAchilles in his turn threw, and struck the round shield of Aeneas at\\nthe very edge, where the bronze was thinnest; the spear of Pelian ash\\nwent clean through, and the shield rang under the blow; Aeneas was\\nafraid, and crouched backwards, holding the shield away from him; the\\nspear, however, flew over his back, and stuck quivering in the ground,\\nafter having gone through both circles of the sheltering shield. Aeneas\\nthough he had avoided the spear, stood still, blinded with fear and\\ngrief because the weapon had gone so near him; then Achilles sprang\\nfuriously upon him, with a cry as of death and with his keen blade\\ndrawn, and Aeneas seized a great stone, so huge that two men, as men\\nnow are, would be unable to lift it, but Aeneas wielded it quite easily.\\n\\nAeneas would then have struck Achilles as he was springing towards him,\\neither on the helmet, or on the shield that covered him, and Achilles\\nwould have closed with him and despatched him with his sword, had not\\nNeptune lord of the earthquake been quick to mark, and said forthwith\\nto the immortals, \"Alas, I am sorry for great Aeneas, who will now go\\ndown to the house of Hades, vanquished by the son of Peleus. Fool that\\nhe was to give ear to the counsel of Apollo. Apollo will never save him\\nfrom destruction. Why should this man suffer when he is guiltless, to\\nno purpose, and in another\\'s quarrel? Has he not at all times offered\\nacceptable sacrifice to the gods that dwell in heaven? Let us then\\nsnatch him from death\\'s jaws, lest the son of Saturn be angry should\\nAchilles slay him. It is fated, moreover, that he should escape, and\\nthat the race of Dardanus, whom Jove loved above all the sons born to\\nhim of mortal women, shall not perish utterly without seed or sign. For\\nnow indeed has Jove hated the blood of Priam, while Aeneas shall reign\\nover the Trojans, he and his children\\'s children that shall be born\\nhereafter.\"\\n\\nThen answered Juno, \"Earth-shaker, look to this matter yourself, and\\nconsider concerning Aeneas, whether you will save him, or suffer him,\\nbrave though he be, to fall by the hand of Achilles son of Peleus. For\\nof a truth we two, I and Pallas Minerva, have sworn full many a time\\nbefore all the immortals, that never would we shield Trojans from\\ndestruction, not even when all Troy is burning in the flames that the\\nAchaeans shall kindle.\"\\n\\nWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went into the battle amid\\nthe clash of spears, and came to the place where Achilles and Aeneas\\nwere. Forthwith he shed a darkness before the eyes of the son of\\nPeleus, drew the bronze-headed ashen spear from the shield of Aeneas,\\nand laid it at the feet of Achilles. Then he lifted Aeneas on high from\\noff the earth and hurried him away. Over the heads of many a band of\\nwarriors both horse and foot did he soar as the god\\'s hand sped him,\\ntill he came to the very fringe of the battle where the Cauconians were\\narming themselves for fight. Neptune, shaker of the earth, then came\\nnear to him and said, \"Aeneas, what god has egged you on to this folly\\nin fighting the son of Peleus, who is both a mightier man of valour and\\nmore beloved of heaven than you are? Give way before him whensoever you\\nmeet him, lest you go down to the house of Hades even though fate would\\nhave it otherwise. When Achilles is dead you may then fight among the\\nforemost undaunted, for none other of the Achaeans shall slay you.\"\\n\\nThe god left him when he had given him these instructions, and at once\\nremoved the darkness from before the eyes of Achilles, who opened them\\nwide indeed and said in great anger, \"Alas! what marvel am I now\\nbeholding? Here is my spear upon the ground, but I see not him whom I\\nmeant to kill when I hurled it. Of a truth Aeneas also must be under\\nheaven\\'s protection, although I had thought his boasting was idle. Let\\nhim go hang; he will be in no mood to fight me further, seeing how\\nnarrowly he has missed being killed. I will now give my orders to the\\nDanaans and attack some other of the Trojans.\"\\n\\nHe sprang forward along the line and cheered his men on as he did so.\\n\"Let not the Trojans,\" he cried, \"keep you at arm\\'s length, Achaeans,\\nbut go for them and fight them man for man. However valiant I may be, I\\ncannot give chase to so many and fight all of them. Even Mars, who is\\nan immortal, or Minerva, would shrink from flinging himself into the\\njaws of such a fight and laying about him; nevertheless, so far as in\\nme lies I will show no slackness of hand or foot nor want of endurance,\\nnot even for a moment; I will utterly break their ranks, and woe to the\\nTrojan who shall venture within reach of my spear.\"\\n\\nThus did he exhort them. Meanwhile Hector called upon the Trojans and\\ndeclared that he would fight Achilles. \"Be not afraid, proud Trojans,\"\\nsaid he, \"to face the son of Peleus; I could fight gods myself if the\\nbattle were one of words only, but they would be more than a match for\\nme, if we had to use our spears. Even so the deed of Achilles will fall\\nsomewhat short of his word; he will do in part, and the other part he\\nwill clip short. I will go up against him though his hands be as\\nfire--though his hands be fire and his strength iron.\"\\n\\nThus urged the Trojans lifted up their spears against the Achaeans, and\\nraised the cry of battle as they flung themselves into the midst of\\ntheir ranks. But Phoebus Apollo came up to Hector and said, \"Hector, on\\nno account must you challenge Achilles to single combat; keep a lookout\\nfor him while you are under cover of the others and away from the thick\\nof the fight, otherwise he will either hit you with a spear or cut you\\ndown at close quarters.\"\\n\\nThus he spoke, and Hector drew back within the crowd, for he was afraid\\nwhen he heard what the god had said to him. Achilles then sprang upon\\nthe Trojans with a terrible cry, clothed in valour as with a garment.\\nFirst he killed Iphition son of Otrynteus, a leader of much people whom\\na naiad nymph had borne to Otrynteus waster of cities, in the land of\\nHyde under the snowy heights of Mt. Tmolus. Achilles struck him full on\\nthe head as he was coming on towards him, and split it clean in two;\\nwhereon he fell heavily to the ground and Achilles vaunted over him\\nsaying, \"You be low, son of Otrynteus, mighty hero; your death is here,\\nbut your lineage is on the Gygaean lake where your father\\'s estate\\nlies, by Hyllus, rich in fish, and the eddying waters of Hermus.\"\\n\\nThus did he vaunt, but darkness closed the eyes of the other. The\\nchariots of the Achaeans cut him up as their wheels passed over him in\\nthe front of the battle, and after him Achilles killed Demoleon, a\\nvaliant man of war and son to Antenor. He struck him on the temple\\nthrough his bronze-cheeked helmet. The helmet did not stay the spear,\\nbut it went right on, crushing the bone so that the brain inside was\\nshed in all directions, and his lust of fighting was ended. Then he\\nstruck Hippodamas in the midriff as he was springing down from his\\nchariot in front of him, and trying to escape. He breathed his last,\\nbellowing like a bull bellows when young men are dragging him to offer\\nhim in sacrifice to the King of Helice, and the heart of the\\nearth-shaker is glad; even so did he bellow as he lay dying. Achilles\\nthen went in pursuit of Polydorus son of Priam, whom his father had\\nalways forbidden to fight because he was the youngest of his sons, the\\none he loved best, and the fastest runner. He, in his folly and showing\\noff the fleetness of his feet, was rushing about among front ranks\\nuntil he lost his life, for Achilles struck him in the middle of the\\nback as he was darting past him: he struck him just at the golden\\nfastenings of his belt and where the two pieces of the double\\nbreastplate overlapped. The point of the spear pierced him through and\\ncame out by the navel, whereon he fell groaning on to his knees and a\\ncloud of darkness overshadowed him as he sank holding his entrails in\\nhis hands.\\n\\nWhen Hector saw his brother Polydorus with his entrails in his hands\\nand sinking down upon the ground, a mist came over his eyes, and he\\ncould not bear to keep longer at a distance; he therefore poised his\\nspear and darted towards Achilles like a flame of fire. When Achilles\\nsaw him he bounded forward and vaunted saying, \"This is he that has\\nwounded my heart most deeply and has slain my beloved comrade. Not for\\nlong shall we two quail before one another on the highways of war.\"\\n\\nHe looked fiercely on Hector and said, \"Draw near, that you may meet\\nyour doom the sooner.\" Hector feared him not and answered, \"Son of\\nPeleus, think not that your words can scare me as though I were a\\nchild; I too if I will can brag and talk unseemly; I know that you are\\na mighty warrior, mightier by far than I, nevertheless the issue lies\\nin the lap of heaven whether I, worse man though I be, may not slay you\\nwith my spear, for this too has been found keen ere now.\"\\n\\nHe hurled his spear as he spoke, but Minerva breathed upon it, and\\nthough she breathed but very lightly she turned it back from going\\ntowards Achilles, so that it returned to Hector and lay at his feet in\\nfront of him. Achilles then sprang furiously on him with a loud cry,\\nbent on killing him, but Apollo caught him up easily as a god can, and\\nhid him in a thick darkness. Thrice did Achilles spring towards him\\nspear in hand, and thrice did he waste his blow upon the air. When he\\nrushed forward for the fourth time as though he were a god, he shouted\\naloud saying, \"Hound, this time too you have escaped death--but of a\\ntruth it came exceedingly near you. Phoebus Apollo, to whom it seems\\nyou pray before you go into battle, has again saved you; but if I too\\nhave any friend among the gods I will surely make an end of you when I\\ncome across you at some other time. Now, however, I will pursue and\\novertake other Trojans.\"\\n\\nOn this he struck Dryops with his spear, about the middle of his neck,\\nand he fell headlong at his feet. There he let him lie and stayed\\nDemouchus son of Philetor, a man both brave and of great stature, by\\nhitting him on the knee with a spear; then he smote him with his sword\\nand killed him. After this he sprang on Laogonus and Dardanus, sons of\\nBias, and threw them from their chariot, the one with a blow from a\\nthrown spear, while the other he cut down in hand-to-hand fight. There\\nwas also Tros the son of Alastor--he came up to Achilles and clasped\\nhis knees in the hope that he would spare him and not kill him but let\\nhim go, because they were both of the same age. Fool, he might have\\nknown that he should not prevail with him, for the man was in no mood\\nfor pity or forbearance but was in grim earnest. Therefore when Tros\\nlaid hold of his knees and sought a hearing for his prayers, Achilles\\ndrove his sword into his liver, and the liver came rolling out, while\\nhis bosom was all covered with the black blood that welled from the\\nwound. Thus did death close his eyes as he lay lifeless.\\n\\nAchilles then went up to Mulius and struck him on the ear with a spear,\\nand the bronze spear-head came right out at the other ear. He also\\nstruck Echeclus son of Agenor on the head with his sword, which became\\nwarm with the blood, while death and stern fate closed the eyes of\\nEcheclus. Next in order the bronze point of his spear wounded Deucalion\\nin the fore-arm where the sinews of the elbow are united, whereon he\\nwaited Achilles\\' onset with his arm hanging down and death staring him\\nin the face. Achilles cut his head off with a blow from his sword and\\nflung it helmet and all away from him, and the marrow came oozing out\\nof his backbone as he lay. He then went in pursuit of Rhigmus, noble\\nson of Peires, who had come from fertile Thrace, and struck him through\\nthe middle with a spear which fixed itself in his belly, so that he\\nfell headlong from his chariot. He also speared Areithous squire to\\nRhigmus in the back as he was turning his horses in flight, and thrust\\nhim from his chariot, while the horses were struck with panic.\\n\\nAs a fire raging in some mountain glen after long drought--and the\\ndense forest is in a blaze, while the wind carries great tongues of\\nfire in every direction--even so furiously did Achilles rage, wielding\\nhis spear as though he were a god, and giving chase to those whom he\\nwould slay, till the dark earth ran with blood. Or as one who yokes\\nbroad-browed oxen that they may tread barley in a threshing-floor--and\\nit is soon bruised small under the feet of the lowing cattle--even so\\ndid the horses of Achilles trample on the shields and bodies of the\\nslain. The axle underneath and the railing that ran round the car were\\nbespattered with clots of blood thrown up by the horses\\' hoofs, and\\nfrom the tyres of the wheels; but the son of Peleus pressed on to win\\nstill further glory, and his hands were bedrabbled with gore.',\n",
       " 'BOOK XIX\\n\\n  Achilles is reconciled with Agamemnon, puts on the armour\\n  which Vulcan had made him, and goes out to fight.\\n\\nNOW when Dawn in robe of saffron was hasting from the streams of\\nOceanus, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached the\\nships with the armour that the god had given her. She found her son\\nfallen about the body of Patroclus and weeping bitterly. Many also of\\nhis followers were weeping round him, but when the goddess came among\\nthem she clasped his hand in her own, saying, \"My son, grieve as we may\\nwe must let this man lie, for it is by heaven\\'s will that he has\\nfallen; now, therefore, accept from Vulcan this rich and goodly armour,\\nwhich no man has ever yet borne upon his shoulders.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she set the armour before Achilles, and it rang out\\nbravely as she did so. The Myrmidons were struck with awe, and none\\ndared look full at it, for they were afraid; but Achilles was roused to\\nstill greater fury, and his eyes gleamed with a fierce light, for he\\nwas glad when he handled the splendid present which the god had made\\nhim. Then, as soon as he had satisfied himself with looking at it, he\\nsaid to his mother, \"Mother, the god has given me armour, meet\\nhandiwork for an immortal and such as no-one living could have\\nfashioned; I will now arm, but I much fear that flies will settle upon\\nthe son of Menoetius and breed worms about his wounds, so that his\\nbody, now he is dead, will be disfigured and the flesh will rot.\"\\n\\nSilver-footed Thetis answered, \"My son, be not disquieted about this\\nmatter. I will find means to protect him from the swarms of noisome\\nflies that prey on the bodies of men who have been killed in battle. He\\nmay lie for a whole year, and his flesh shall still be as sound as\\never, or even sounder. Call, therefore, the Achaean heroes in assembly;\\nunsay your anger against Agamemnon; arm at once, and fight with might\\nand main.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she put strength and courage into his heart, and she then\\ndropped ambrosia and red nectar into the wounds of Patroclus, that his\\nbody might suffer no change.\\n\\nThen Achilles went out upon the seashore, and with a loud cry called on\\nthe Achaean heroes. On this even those who as yet had stayed always at\\nthe ships, the pilots and helmsmen, and even the stewards who were\\nabout the ships and served out rations, all came to the place of\\nassembly because Achilles had shown himself after having held aloof so\\nlong from fighting. Two sons of Mars, Ulysses and the son of Tydeus,\\ncame limping, for their wounds still pained them; nevertheless they\\ncame, and took their seats in the front row of the assembly. Last of\\nall came Agamemnon, king of men, he too wounded, for Coon son of\\nAntenor had struck him with a spear in battle.\\n\\nWhen the Achaeans were got together Achilles rose and said, \"Son of\\nAtreus, surely it would have been better alike for both you and me,\\nwhen we two were in such high anger about Briseis, surely it would have\\nbeen better, had Diana\\'s arrow slain her at the ships on the day when I\\ntook her after having sacked Lyrnessus. For so, many an Achaean the\\nless would have bitten dust before the foe in the days of my anger. It\\nhas been well for Hector and the Trojans, but the Achaeans will long\\nindeed remember our quarrel. Now, however, let it be, for it is over.\\nIf we have been angry, necessity has schooled our anger. I put it from\\nme: I dare not nurse it for ever; therefore, bid the Achaeans arm\\nforthwith that I may go out against the Trojans, and learn whether they\\nwill be in a mind to sleep by the ships or no. Glad, I ween, will he be\\nto rest his knees who may fly my spear when I wield it.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and the Achaeans rejoiced in that he had put away\\nhis anger.\\n\\nThen Agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into the\\nmiddle of the assembly. \"Danaan heroes,\" said he, \"servants of Mars, it\\nis well to listen when a man stands up to speak, and it is not seemly\\nto interrupt him, or it will go hard even with a practised speaker. Who\\ncan either hear or speak in an uproar? Even the finest orator will be\\ndisconcerted by it. I will expound to the son of Peleus, and do you\\nother Achaeans heed me and mark me well. Often have the Achaeans spoken\\nto me of this matter and upbraided me, but it was not I that did it:\\nJove, and Fate, and Erinys that walks in darkness struck me mad when we\\nwere assembled on the day that I took from Achilles the meed that had\\nbeen awarded to him. What could I do? All things are in the hand of\\nheaven, and Folly, eldest of Jove\\'s daughters, shuts men\\'s eyes to\\ntheir destruction. She walks delicately, not on the solid earth, but\\nhovers over the heads of men to make them stumble or to ensnare them.\\n\\n\"Time was when she fooled Jove himself, who they say is greatest\\nwhether of gods or men; for Juno, woman though she was, beguiled him on\\nthe day when Alcmena was to bring forth mighty Hercules in the fair\\ncity of Thebes. He told it out among the gods saying, \\'Hear me, all\\ngods and goddesses, that I may speak even as I am minded; this day\\nshall an Ilithuia, helper of women who are in labour, bring a man child\\ninto the world who shall be lord over all that dwell about him who are\\nof my blood and lineage.\\' Then said Juno all crafty and full of guile,\\n\\'You will play false, and will not hold to your word. Swear me, O\\nOlympian, swear me a great oath, that he who shall this day fall\\nbetween the feet of a woman, shall be lord over all that dwell about\\nhim who are of your blood and lineage.\\'\\n\\n\"Thus she spoke, and Jove suspected her not, but swore the great oath,\\nto his much ruing thereafter. For Juno darted down from the high summit\\nof Olympus, and went in haste to Achaean Argos where she knew that the\\nnoble wife of Sthenelus son of Perseus then was. She being with child\\nand in her seventh month, Juno brought the child to birth though there\\nwas a month still wanting, but she stayed the offspring of Alcmena, and\\nkept back the Ilithuiae. Then she went to tell Jove the son of Saturn,\\nand said, \\'Father Jove, lord of the lightning--I have a word for your\\near. There is a fine child born this day, Eurystheus, son to Sthenelus\\nthe son of Perseus; he is of your lineage; it is well, therefore, that\\nhe should reign over the Argives.\\'\\n\\n\"On this Jove was stung to the very quick, and in his rage he caught\\nFolly by the hair, and swore a great oath that never should she again\\ninvade starry heaven and Olympus, for she was the bane of all. Then he\\nwhirled her round with a twist of his hand, and flung her down from\\nheaven so that she fell on to the fields of mortal men; and he was ever\\nangry with her when he saw his son groaning under the cruel labours\\nthat Eurystheus laid upon him. Even so did I grieve when mighty Hector\\nwas killing the Argives at their ships, and all the time I kept\\nthinking of Folly who had so baned me. I was blind, and Jove robbed me\\nof my reason; I will now make atonement, and will add much treasure by\\nway of amends. Go, therefore, into battle, you and your people with\\nyou. I will give you all that Ulysses offered you yesterday in your\\ntents: or if it so please you, wait, though you would fain fight at\\nonce, and my squires shall bring the gifts from my ship, that you may\\nsee whether what I give you is enough.\"\\n\\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, you can\\ngive such gifts as you think proper, or you can withhold them: it is in\\nyour own hands. Let us now set battle in array; it is not well to tarry\\ntalking about trifles, for there is a deed which is as yet to do.\\nAchilles shall again be seen fighting among the foremost, and laying\\nlow the ranks of the Trojans: bear this in mind each one of you when he\\nis fighting.\"\\n\\nThen Ulysses said, \"Achilles, godlike and brave, send not the Achaeans\\nthus against Ilius to fight the Trojans fasting, for the battle will be\\nno brief one, when it is once begun, and heaven has filled both sides\\nwith fury; bid them first take food both bread and wine by the ships,\\nfor in this there is strength and stay. No man can do battle the\\nlivelong day to the going down of the sun if he is without food;\\nhowever much he may want to fight his strength will fail him before he\\nknows it; hunger and thirst will find him out, and his limbs will grow\\nweary under him. But a man can fight all day if he is full fed with\\nmeat and wine; his heart beats high, and his strength will stay till he\\nhas routed all his foes; therefore, send the people away and bid them\\nprepare their meal; King Agamemnon will bring out the gifts in presence\\nof the assembly, that all may see them and you may be satisfied.\\nMoreover let him swear an oath before the Argives that he has never\\ngone up into the couch of Briseis, nor been with her after the manner\\nof men and women; and do you, too, show yourself of a gracious mind;\\nlet Agamemnon entertain you in his tents with a feast of\\nreconciliation, that so you may have had your dues in full. As for you,\\nson of Atreus, treat people more righteously in future; it is no\\ndisgrace even to a king that he should make amends if he was wrong in\\nthe first instance.\"\\n\\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Son of Laertes, your words please me\\nwell, for throughout you have spoken wisely. I will swear as you would\\nhave me do; I do so of my own free will, neither shall I take the name\\nof heaven in vain. Let, then, Achilles wait, though he would fain fight\\nat once, and do you others wait also, till the gifts come from my tent\\nand we ratify the oath with sacrifice. Thus, then, do I charge you:\\ntake some noble young Achaeans with you, and bring from my tents the\\ngifts that I promised yesterday to Achilles, and bring the women also;\\nfurthermore let Talthybius find me a boar from those that are with the\\nhost, and make it ready for sacrifice to Jove and to the sun.\"\\n\\nThen said Achilles, \"Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, see to these\\nmatters at some other season, when there is breathing time and when I\\nam calmer. Would you have men eat while the bodies of those whom Hector\\nson of Priam slew are still lying mangled upon the plain? Let the sons\\nof the Achaeans, say I, fight fasting and without food, till we have\\navenged them; afterwards at the going down of the sun let them eat\\ntheir fill. As for me, Patroclus is lying dead in my tent, all hacked\\nand hewn, with his feet to the door, and his comrades are mourning\\nround him. Therefore I can take thought of nothing save only slaughter\\nand blood and the rattle in the throat of the dying.\"\\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Achilles, son of Peleus, mightiest of all the\\nAchaeans, in battle you are better than I, and that more than a little,\\nbut in counsel I am much before you, for I am older and of greater\\nknowledge. Therefore be patient under my words. Fighting is a thing of\\nwhich men soon surfeit, and when Jove, who is war\\'s steward, weighs the\\nupshot, it may well prove that the straw which our sickles have reaped\\nis far heavier than the grain. It may not be that the Achaeans should\\nmourn the dead with their bellies; day by day men fall thick and\\nthreefold continually; when should we have respite from our sorrow? Let\\nus mourn our dead for a day and bury them out of sight and mind, but\\nlet those of us who are left eat and drink that we may arm and fight\\nour foes more fiercely. In that hour let no man hold back, waiting for\\na second summons; such summons shall bode ill for him who is found\\nlagging behind at our ships; let us rather sally as one man and loose\\nthe fury of war upon the Trojans.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus spoken he took with him the sons of Nestor, with Meges\\nson of Phyleus, Thoas, Meriones, Lycomedes son of Creontes, and\\nMelanippus, and went to the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus. The word\\nwas not sooner said than the deed was done: they brought out the seven\\ntripods which Agamemnon had promised, with the twenty metal cauldrons\\nand the twelve horses; they also brought the women skilled in useful\\narts, seven in number, with Briseis, which made eight. Ulysses weighed\\nout the ten talents of gold and then led the way back, while the young\\nAchaeans brought the rest of the gifts, and laid them in the middle of\\nthe assembly.\\n\\nAgamemnon then rose, and Talthybius whose voice was like that of a god\\ncame to him with the boar. The son of Atreus drew the knife which he\\nwore by the scabbard of his mighty sword, and began by cutting off some\\nbristles from the boar, lifting up his hands in prayer as he did so.\\nThe other Achaeans sat where they were all silent and orderly to hear\\nthe king, and Agamemnon looked into the vault of heaven and prayed\\nsaying, \"I call Jove the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, I\\ncall also Earth and Sun and the Erinyes who dwell below and take\\nvengeance on him who shall swear falsely, that I have laid no hand upon\\nthe girl Briseis, neither to take her to my bed nor otherwise, but that\\nshe has remained in my tents inviolate. If I swear falsely may heaven\\nvisit me with all the penalties which it metes out to those who perjure\\nthemselves.\"\\n\\nHe cut the boar\\'s throat as he spoke, whereon Talthybius whirled it\\nround his head, and flung it into the wide sea to feed the fishes. Then\\nAchilles also rose and said to the Argives, \"Father Jove, of a truth\\nyou blind men\\'s eyes and bane them. The son of Atreus had not else\\nstirred me to so fierce an anger, nor so stubbornly taken Briseis from\\nme against my will. Surely Jove must have counselled the destruction of\\nmany an Argive. Go, now, and take your food that we may begin fighting.\"\\n\\nOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own\\nship. The Myrmidons attended to the presents and took them away to the\\nship of Achilles. They placed them in his tents, while the stable-men\\ndrove the horses in among the others.\\n\\nBriseis, fair as Venus, when she saw the mangled body of Patroclus,\\nflung herself upon it and cried aloud, tearing her breast, her neck,\\nand her lovely face with both her hands. Beautiful as a goddess she\\nwept and said, \"Patroclus, dearest friend, when I went hence I left you\\nliving; I return, O prince, to find you dead; thus do fresh sorrows\\nmultiply upon me one after the other. I saw him to whom my father and\\nmother married me, cut down before our city, and my three own dear\\nbrothers perished with him on the self-same day; but you, Patroclus,\\neven when Achilles slew my husband and sacked the city of noble Mynes,\\ntold me that I was not to weep, for you said you would make Achilles\\nmarry me, and take me back with him to Phthia, we should have a wedding\\nfeast among the Myrmidons. You were always kind to me and I shall never\\ncease to grieve for you.\"\\n\\nShe wept as she spoke, and the women joined in her lament-making as\\nthough their tears were for Patroclus, but in truth each was weeping\\nfor her own sorrows. The elders of the Achaeans gathered round Achilles\\nand prayed him to take food, but he groaned and would not do so. \"I\\npray you,\" said he, \"if any comrade will hear me, bid me neither eat\\nnor drink, for I am in great heaviness, and will stay fasting even to\\nthe going down of the sun.\"\\n\\nOn this he sent the other princes away, save only the two sons of\\nAtreus and Ulysses, Nestor, Idomeneus, and the knight Phoenix, who\\nstayed behind and tried to comfort him in the bitterness of his sorrow:\\nbut he would not be comforted till he should have flung himself into\\nthe jaws of battle, and he fetched sigh on sigh, thinking ever of\\nPatroclus. Then he said--\\n\\n\"Hapless and dearest comrade, you it was who would get a good dinner\\nready for me at once and without delay when the Achaeans were hasting\\nto fight the Trojans; now, therefore, though I have meat and drink in\\nmy tents, yet will I fast for sorrow. Grief greater than this I could\\nnot know, not even though I were to hear of the death of my father, who\\nis now in Phthia weeping for the loss of me his son, who am here\\nfighting the Trojans in a strange land for the accursed sake of Helen,\\nnor yet though I should hear that my son is no more--he who is being\\nbrought up in Scyros--if indeed Neoptolemus is still living. Till now I\\nmade sure that I alone was to fall here at Troy away from Argos, while\\nyou were to return to Phthia, bring back my son with you in your own\\nship, and show him all my property, my bondsmen, and the greatness of\\nmy house--for Peleus must surely be either dead, or what little life\\nremains to him is oppressed alike with the infirmities of age and ever\\npresent fear lest he should hear the sad tidings of my death.\"\\n\\nHe wept as he spoke, and the elders sighed in concert as each thought\\non what he had left at home behind him. The son of Saturn looked down\\nwith pity upon them, and said presently to Minerva, \"My child, you have\\nquite deserted your hero; is he then gone so clean out of your\\nrecollection? There he sits by the ships all desolate for the loss of\\nhis dear comrade, and though the others are gone to their dinner he\\nwill neither eat nor drink. Go then and drop nectar and ambrosia into\\nhis breast, that he may know no hunger.\"\\n\\nWith these words he urged Minerva, who was already of the same mind.\\nShe darted down from heaven into the air like some falcon sailing on\\nhis broad wings and screaming. Meanwhile the Achaeans were arming\\nthroughout the host, and when Minerva had dropped nectar and ambrosia\\ninto Achilles so that no cruel hunger should cause his limbs to fail\\nhim, she went back to the house of her mighty father. Thick as the\\nchill snow-flakes shed from the hand of Jove and borne on the keen\\nblasts of the north wind, even so thick did the gleaming helmets, the\\nbossed shields, the strongly plated breastplates, and the ashen spears\\nstream from the ships. The sheen pierced the sky, the whole land was\\nradiant with their flashing armour, and the sound of the tramp of their\\ntreading rose from under their feet. In the midst of them all Achilles\\nput on his armour; he gnashed his teeth, his eyes gleamed like fire,\\nfor his grief was greater than he could bear. Thus, then, full of fury\\nagainst the Trojans, did he don the gift of the god, the armour that\\nVulcan had made him.\\n\\nFirst he put on the goodly greaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and next\\nhe did on the breastplate about his chest. He slung the silver-studded\\nsword of bronze about his shoulders, and then took up the shield so\\ngreat and strong that shone afar with a splendour as of the moon. As\\nthe light seen by sailors from out at sea, when men have lit a fire in\\ntheir homestead high up among the mountains, but the sailors are\\ncarried out to sea by wind and storm far from the haven where they\\nwould be--even so did the gleam of Achilles\\' wondrous shield strike up\\ninto the heavens. He lifted the redoubtable helmet, and set it upon his\\nhead, from whence it shone like a star, and the golden plumes which\\nVulcan had set thick about the ridge of the helmet, waved all around\\nit. Then Achilles made trial of himself in his armour to see whether it\\nfitted him, so that his limbs could play freely under it, and it seemed\\nto buoy him up as though it had been wings.\\n\\nHe also drew his father\\'s spear out of the spear-stand, a spear so\\ngreat and heavy and strong that none of the Achaeans save only Achilles\\nhad strength to wield it; this was the spear of Pelian ash from the\\ntopmost ridges of Mt. Pelion, which Chiron had once given to Peleus,\\nfraught with the death of heroes. Automedon and Alcimus busied\\nthemselves with the harnessing of his horses; they made the bands fast\\nabout them, and put the bit in their mouths, drawing the reins back\\ntowards the chariot. Automedon, whip in hand, sprang up behind the\\nhorses, and after him Achilles mounted in full armour, resplendent as\\nthe sun-god Hyperion. Then with a loud voice he chided with his\\nfather\\'s horses saying, \"Xanthus and Balius, famed offspring of\\nPodarge--this time when we have done fighting be sure and bring your\\ndriver safely back to the host of the Achaeans, and do not leave him\\ndead on the plain as you did Patroclus.\"\\n\\nThen fleet Xanthus answered under the yoke--for white-armed Juno had\\nendowed him with human speech--and he bowed his head till his mane\\ntouched the ground as it hung down from under the yoke-band. \"Dread\\nAchilles,\" said he, \"we will indeed save you now, but the day of your\\ndeath is near, and the blame will not be ours, for it will be heaven\\nand stern fate that will destroy you. Neither was it through any sloth\\nor slackness on our part that the Trojans stripped Patroclus of his\\narmour; it was the mighty god whom lovely Leto bore that slew him as he\\nfought among the foremost, and vouchsafed a triumph to Hector. We two\\ncan fly as swiftly as Zephyrus who they say is fleetest of all winds;\\nnevertheless it is your doom to fall by the hand of a man and of a god.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus said the Erinyes stayed his speech, and Achilles\\nanswered him in great sadness, saying, \"Why, O Xanthus, do you thus\\nforetell my death? You need not do so, for I well know that I am to\\nfall here, far from my dear father and mother; none the more, however,\\nshall I stay my hand till I have given the Trojans their fill of\\nfighting.\"\\n\\nSo saying, with a loud cry he drove his horses to the front.',\n",
       " 'BOOK XXIV\\n\\n  Priam ransoms the body of Hector--Hector\\'s funeral.\\n\\nTHE assembly now broke up and the people went their ways each to his\\nown ship. There they made ready their supper, and then bethought them\\nof the blessed boon of sleep; but Achilles still wept for thinking of\\nhis dear comrade, and sleep, before whom all things bow, could take no\\nhold upon him. This way and that did he turn as he yearned after the\\nmight and manfulness of Patroclus; he thought of all they had done\\ntogether, and all they had gone through both on the field of battle and\\non the waves of the weary sea. As he dwelt on these things he wept\\nbitterly and lay now on his side, now on his back, and now face\\ndownwards, till at last he rose and went out as one distraught to\\nwander upon the seashore. Then, when he saw dawn breaking over beach\\nand sea, he yoked his horses to his chariot, and bound the body of\\nHector behind it that he might drag it about. Thrice did he drag it\\nround the tomb of the son of Menoetius, and then went back into his\\ntent, leaving the body on the ground full length and with its face\\ndownwards. But Apollo would not suffer it to be disfigured, for he\\npitied the man, dead though he now was; therefore he shielded him with\\nhis golden aegis continually, that he might take no hurt while Achilles\\nwas dragging him.\\n\\nThus shamefully did Achilles in his fury dishonour Hector; but the\\nblessed gods looked down in pity from heaven, and urged Mercury, slayer\\nof Argus, to steal the body. All were of this mind save only Juno,\\nNeptune, and Jove\\'s grey-eyed daughter, who persisted in the hate which\\nthey had ever borne towards Ilius with Priam and his people; for they\\nforgave not the wrong done them by Alexandrus in disdaining the\\ngoddesses who came to him when he was in his sheepyards, and preferring\\nher who had offered him a wanton to his ruin.\\n\\nWhen, therefore, the morning of the twelfth day had now come, Phoebus\\nApollo spoke among the immortals saying, \"You gods ought to be ashamed\\nof yourselves; you are cruel and hard-hearted. Did not Hector burn you\\nthigh-bones of heifers and of unblemished goats? And now dare you not\\nrescue even his dead body, for his wife to look upon, with his mother\\nand child, his father Priam, and his people, who would forthwith commit\\nhim to the flames, and give him his due funeral rites? So, then, you\\nwould all be on the side of mad Achilles, who knows neither right nor\\nruth? He is like some savage lion that in the pride of his great\\nstrength and daring springs upon men\\'s flocks and gorges on them. Even\\nso has Achilles flung aside all pity, and all that conscience which at\\nonce so greatly banes yet greatly boons him that will heed it. A man\\nmay lose one far dearer than Achilles has lost--a son, it may be, or a\\nbrother born from his own mother\\'s womb; yet when he has mourned him\\nand wept over him he will let him bide, for it takes much sorrow to\\nkill a man; whereas Achilles, now that he has slain noble Hector, drags\\nhim behind his chariot round the tomb of his comrade. It were better of\\nhim, and for him, that he should not do so, for brave though he be we\\ngods may take it ill that he should vent his fury upon dead clay.\"\\n\\nJuno spoke up in a rage. \"This were well,\" she cried, \"O lord of the\\nsilver bow, if you would give like honour to Hector and to Achilles;\\nbut Hector was mortal and suckled at a woman\\'s breast, whereas Achilles\\nis the offspring of a goddess whom I myself reared and brought up. I\\nmarried her to Peleus, who is above measure dear to the immortals; you\\ngods came all of you to her wedding; you feasted along with them\\nyourself and brought your lyre--false, and fond of low company, that\\nyou have ever been.\"\\n\\nThen said Jove, \"Juno, be not so bitter. Their honour shall not be\\nequal, but of all that dwell in Ilius, Hector was dearest to the gods,\\nas also to myself, for his offerings never failed me. Never was my\\naltar stinted of its dues, nor of the drink-offerings and savour of\\nsacrifice which we claim of right. I shall therefore permit the body of\\nmighty Hector to be stolen; and yet this may hardly be without Achilles\\ncoming to know it, for his mother keeps night and day beside him. Let\\nsome one of you, therefore, send Thetis to me, and I will impart my\\ncounsel to her, namely that Achilles is to accept a ransom from Priam,\\nand give up the body.\"\\n\\nOn this Iris fleet as the wind went forth to carry his message. Down\\nshe plunged into the dark sea midway between Samos and rocky Imbrus;\\nthe waters hissed as they closed over her, and she sank into the bottom\\nas the lead at the end of an ox-horn, that is sped to carry death to\\nfishes. She found Thetis sitting in a great cave with the other\\nsea-goddesses gathered round her; there she sat in the midst of them\\nweeping for her noble son who was to fall far from his own land, on the\\nrich plains of Troy. Iris went up to her and said, \"Rise Thetis; Jove,\\nwhose counsels fail not, bids you come to him.\" And Thetis answered,\\n\"Why does the mighty god so bid me? I am in great grief, and shrink\\nfrom going in and out among the immortals. Still, I will go, and the\\nword that he may speak shall not be spoken in vain.\"\\n\\nThe goddess took her dark veil, than which there can be no robe more\\nsombre, and went forth with fleet Iris leading the way before her. The\\nwaves of the sea opened them a path, and when they reached the shore\\nthey flew up into the heavens, where they found the all-seeing son of\\nSaturn with the blessed gods that live for ever assembled near him.\\nMinerva gave up her seat to her, and she sat down by the side of father\\nJove. Juno then placed a fair golden cup in her hand, and spoke to her\\nin words of comfort, whereon Thetis drank and gave her back the cup;\\nand the sire of gods and men was the first to speak.\\n\\n\"So, goddess,\" said he, \"for all your sorrow, and the grief that I well\\nknow reigns ever in your heart, you have come hither to Olympus, and I\\nwill tell you why I have sent for you. This nine days past the\\nimmortals have been quarrelling about Achilles waster of cities and the\\nbody of Hector. The gods would have Mercury slayer of Argus steal the\\nbody, but in furtherance of our peace and amity henceforward, I will\\nconcede such honour to your son as I will now tell you. Go, then, to\\nthe host and lay these commands upon him; say that the gods are angry\\nwith him, and that I am myself more angry than them all, in that he\\nkeeps Hector at the ships and will not give him up. He may thus fear me\\nand let the body go. At the same time I will send Iris to great Priam\\nto bid him go to the ships of the Achaeans, and ransom his son, taking\\nwith him such gifts for Achilles as may give him satisfaction.\"\\n\\nSilver-footed Thetis did as the god had told her, and forthwith down\\nshe darted from the topmost summits of Olympus. She went to her son\\'s\\ntents where she found him grieving bitterly, while his trusty comrades\\nround him were busy preparing their morning meal, for which they had\\nkilled a great woolly sheep. His mother sat down beside him and\\ncaressed him with her hand saying, \"My son, how long will you keep on\\nthus grieving and making moan? You are gnawing at your own heart, and\\nthink neither of food nor of woman\\'s embraces; and yet these too were\\nwell, for you have no long time to live, and death with the strong hand\\nof fate are already close beside you. Now, therefore, heed what I say,\\nfor I come as a messenger from Jove; he says that the gods are angry\\nwith you, and himself more angry than them all, in that you keep Hector\\nat the ships and will not give him up. Therefore let him go, and accept\\na ransom for his body.\"\\n\\nAnd Achilles answered, \"So be it. If Olympian Jove of his own motion\\nthus commands me, let him that brings the ransom bear the body away.\"\\n\\nThus did mother and son talk together at the ships in long discourse\\nwith one another. Meanwhile the son of Saturn sent Iris to the strong\\ncity of Ilius. \"Go,\" said he, \"fleet Iris, from the mansions of\\nOlympus, and tell King Priam in Ilius, that he is to go to the ships of\\nthe Achaeans and free the body of his dear son. He is to take such\\ngifts with him as shall give satisfaction to Achilles, and he is to go\\nalone, with no other Trojan, save only some honoured servant who may\\ndrive his mules and waggon, and bring back the body of him whom noble\\nAchilles has slain. Let him have no thought nor fear of death in his\\nheart, for we will send the slayer of Argus to escort him, and bring\\nhim within the tent of Achilles. Achilles will not kill him nor let\\nanother do so, for he will take heed to his ways and sin not, and he\\nwill entreat a suppliant with all honourable courtesy.\"\\n\\nOn this Iris, fleet as the wind, sped forth to deliver her message. She\\nwent to Priam\\'s house, and found weeping and lamentation therein. His\\nsons were seated round their father in the outer courtyard, and their\\nraiment was wet with tears: the old man sat in the midst of them with\\nhis mantle wrapped close about his body, and his head and neck all\\ncovered with the filth which he had clutched as he lay grovelling in\\nthe mire. His daughters and his sons\\' wives went wailing about the\\nhouse, as they thought of the many and brave men who lay dead, slain by\\nthe Argives. The messenger of Jove stood by Priam and spoke softly to\\nhim, but fear fell upon him as she did so. \"Take heart,\" she said,\\n\"Priam offspring of Dardanus, take heart and fear not. I bring no evil\\ntidings, but am minded well towards you. I come as a messenger from\\nJove, who though he be not near, takes thought for you and pities you.\\nThe lord of Olympus bids you go and ransom noble Hector, and take with\\nyou such gifts as shall give satisfaction to Achilles. You are to go\\nalone, with no Trojan, save only some honoured servant who may drive\\nyour mules and waggon, and bring back to the city the body of him whom\\nnoble Achilles has slain. You are to have no thought, nor fear of\\ndeath, for Jove will send the slayer of Argus to escort you. When he\\nhas brought you within Achilles\\' tent, Achilles will not kill you nor\\nlet another do so, for he will take heed to his ways and sin not, and\\nhe will entreat a suppliant with all honourable courtesy.\"\\n\\nIris went her way when she had thus spoken, and Priam told his sons to\\nget a mule-waggon ready, and to make the body of the waggon fast upon\\nthe top of its bed. Then he went down into his fragrant store-room,\\nhigh-vaulted, and made of cedar-wood, where his many treasures were\\nkept, and he called Hecuba his wife. \"Wife,\" said he, \"a messenger has\\ncome to me from Olympus, and has told me to go to the ships of the\\nAchaeans to ransom my dear son, taking with me such gifts as shall give\\nsatisfaction to Achilles. What think you of this matter? for my own\\npart I am greatly moved to pass through the camps of the Achaeans and\\ngo to their ships.\"\\n\\nHis wife cried aloud as she heard him, and said, \"Alas, what has become\\nof that judgement for which you have been ever famous both among\\nstrangers and your own people? How can you venture alone to the ships\\nof the Achaeans, and look into the face of him who has slain so many of\\nyour brave sons? You must have iron courage, for if the cruel savage\\nsees you and lays hold on you, he will know neither respect nor pity.\\nLet us then weep Hector from afar here in our own house, for when I\\ngave him birth the threads of overruling fate were spun for him that\\ndogs should eat his flesh far from his parents, in the house of that\\nterrible man on whose liver I would fain fasten and devour it. Thus\\nwould I avenge my son, who showed no cowardice when Achilles slew him,\\nand thought neither of flight nor of avoiding battle as he stood in\\ndefence of Trojan men and Trojan women.\"\\n\\nThen Priam said, \"I would go, do not therefore stay me nor be as a bird\\nof ill omen in my house, for you will not move me. Had it been some\\nmortal man who had sent me some prophet or priest who divines from\\nsacrifice--I should have deemed him false and have given him no heed;\\nbut now I have heard the goddess and seen her face to face, therefore I\\nwill go and her saying shall not be in vain. If it be my fate to die at\\nthe ships of the Achaeans even so would I have it; let Achilles slay\\nme, if I may but first have taken my son in my arms and mourned him to\\nmy heart\\'s comforting.\"\\n\\nSo saying he lifted the lids of his chests, and took out twelve goodly\\nvestments. He took also twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve rugs,\\ntwelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. He weighed out ten\\ntalents of gold, and brought moreover two burnished tripods, four\\ncauldrons, and a very beautiful cup which the Thracians had given him\\nwhen he had gone to them on an embassy; it was very precious, but he\\ngrudged not even this, so eager was he to ransom the body of his son.\\nThen he chased all the Trojans from the court and rebuked them with\\nwords of anger. \"Out,\" he cried, \"shame and disgrace to me that you\\nare. Have you no grief in your own homes that you are come to plague me\\nhere? Is it a small thing, think you, that the son of Saturn has sent\\nthis sorrow upon me, to lose the bravest of my sons? Nay, you shall\\nprove it in person, for now he is gone the Achaeans will have easier\\nwork in killing you. As for me, let me go down within the house of\\nHades, ere mine eyes behold the sacking and wasting of the city.\"\\n\\nHe drove the men away with his staff, and they went forth as the old\\nman sped them. Then he called to his sons, upbraiding Helenus, Paris,\\nnoble Agathon, Pammon, Antiphonus, Polites of the loud battle-cry,\\nDeiphobus, Hippothous, and Dius. These nine did the old man call near\\nhim. \"Come to me at once,\" he cried, \"worthless sons who do me shame;\\nwould that you had all been killed at the ships rather than Hector.\\nMiserable man that I am, I have had the bravest sons in all Troy--noble\\nNestor, Troilus the dauntless charioteer, and Hector who was a god\\namong men, so that one would have thought he was son to an\\nimmortal--yet there is not one of them left. Mars has slain them and\\nthose of whom I am ashamed are alone left me. Liars, and light of foot,\\nheroes of the dance, robbers of lambs and kids from your own people,\\nwhy do you not get a waggon ready for me at once, and put all these\\nthings upon it that I may set out on my way?\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and they feared the rebuke of their father. They\\nbrought out a strong mule-waggon, newly made, and set the body of the\\nwaggon fast on its bed. They took the mule-yoke from the peg on which\\nit hung, a yoke of boxwood with a knob on the top of it and rings for\\nthe reins to go through. Then they brought a yoke-band eleven cubits\\nlong, to bind the yoke to the pole; they bound it on at the far end of\\nthe pole, and put the ring over the upright pin making it fast with\\nthree turns of the band on either side the knob, and bending the thong\\nof the yoke beneath it. This done, they brought from the store-chamber\\nthe rich ransom that was to purchase the body of Hector, and they set\\nit all orderly on the waggon; then they yoked the strong harness-mules\\nwhich the Mysians had on a time given as a goodly present to Priam; but\\nfor Priam himself they yoked horses which the old king had bred, and\\nkept for his own use.\\n\\nThus heedfully did Priam and his servant see to the yolking of their\\ncars at the palace. Then Hecuba came to them all sorrowful, with a\\ngolden goblet of wine in her right hand, that they might make a\\ndrink-offering before they set out. She stood in front of the horses\\nand said, \"Take this, make a drink-offering to father Jove, and since\\nyou are minded to go to the ships in spite of me, pray that you may\\ncome safely back from the hands of your enemies. Pray to the son of\\nSaturn lord of the whirlwind, who sits on Ida and looks down over all\\nTroy, pray him to send his swift messenger on your right hand, the bird\\nof omen which is strongest and most dear to him of all birds, that you\\nmay see it with your own eyes and trust it as you go forth to the ships\\nof the Danaans. If all-seeing Jove will not send you this messenger,\\nhowever set upon it you may be, I would not have you go to the ships of\\nthe Argives.\"\\n\\nAnd Priam answered, \"Wife, I will do as you desire me; it is well to\\nlift hands in prayer to Jove, if so be he may have mercy upon me.\"\\n\\nWith this the old man bade the serving-woman pour pure water over his\\nhands, and the woman came, bearing the water in a bowl. He washed his\\nhands and took the cup from his wife; then he made the drink-offering\\nand prayed, standing in the middle of the courtyard and turning his\\neyes to heaven. \"Father Jove,\" he said, \"that rulest from Ida, most\\nglorious and most great, grant that I may be received kindly and\\ncompassionately in the tents of Achilles; and send your swift messenger\\nupon my right hand, the bird of omen which is strongest and most dear\\nto you of all birds, that I may see it with my own eyes and trust it as\\nI go forth to the ships of the Danaans.\"\\n\\nSo did he pray, and Jove the lord of counsel heard his prayer.\\nForthwith he sent an eagle, the most unerring portent of all birds that\\nfly, the dusky hunter that men also call the Black Eagle. His wings\\nwere spread abroad on either side as wide as the well-made and\\nwell-bolted door of a rich man\\'s chamber. He came to them flying over\\nthe city upon their right hands, and when they saw him they were glad\\nand their hearts took comfort within them. The old man made haste to\\nmount his chariot, and drove out through the inner gateway and under\\nthe echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Before him went the mules\\ndrawing the four-wheeled waggon, and driven by wise Idaeus; behind\\nthese were the horses, which the old man lashed with his whip and drove\\nswiftly through the city, while his friends followed after, wailing and\\nlamenting for him as though he were on his road to death. As soon as\\nthey had come down from the city and had reached the plain, his sons\\nand sons-in-law who had followed him went back to Ilius.\\n\\nBut Priam and Idaeus as they showed out upon the plain did not escape\\nthe ken of all-seeing Jove, who looked down upon the old man and pitied\\nhim; then he spoke to his son Mercury and said, \"Mercury, for it is you\\nwho are the most disposed to escort men on their way, and to hear those\\nwhom you will hear, go, and so conduct Priam to the ships of the\\nAchaeans that no other of the Danaans shall see him nor take note of\\nhim until he reach the son of Peleus.\"\\n\\nThus he spoke and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did as\\nhe was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals with\\nwhich he could fly like the wind over land and sea; he took the wand\\nwith which he seals men\\'s eyes in sleep, or wakes them just as he\\npleases, and flew holding it in his hand till he came to Troy and to\\nthe Hellespont. To look at, he was like a young man of noble birth in\\nthe hey-day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon his\\nface.\\n\\nNow when Priam and Idaeus had driven past the great tomb of Ilius, they\\nstayed their mules and horses that they might drink in the river, for\\nthe shades of night were falling, when, therefore, Idaeus saw Mercury\\nstanding near them he said to Priam, \"Take heed, descendant of\\nDardanus; here is matter which demands consideration. I see a man who I\\nthink will presently fall upon us; let us fly with our horses, or at\\nleast embrace his knees and implore him to take compassion upon us?\"\\n\\nWhen he heard this the old man\\'s heart failed him, and he was in great\\nfear; he stayed where he was as one dazed, and the hair stood on end\\nover his whole body; but the bringer of good luck came up to him and\\ntook him by the hand, saying, \"Whither, father, are you thus driving\\nyour mules and horses in the dead of night when other men are asleep?\\nAre you not afraid of the fierce Achaeans who are hard by you, so cruel\\nand relentless? Should some one of them see you bearing so much\\ntreasure through the darkness of the flying night, what would not your\\nstate then be? You are no longer young, and he who is with you is too\\nold to protect you from those who would attack you. For myself, I will\\ndo you no harm, and I will defend you from any one else, for you remind\\nme of my own father.\"\\n\\nAnd Priam answered, \"It is indeed as you say, my dear son; nevertheless\\nsome god has held his hand over me, in that he has sent such a wayfarer\\nas yourself to meet me so opportunely; you are so comely in mien and\\nfigure, and your judgement is so excellent that you must come of\\nblessed parents.\"\\n\\nThen said the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, \"Sir, all that you\\nhave said is right; but tell me and tell me true, are you taking this\\nrich treasure to send it to a foreign people where it may be safe, or\\nare you all leaving strong Ilius in dismay now that your son has fallen\\nwho was the bravest man among you and was never lacking in battle with\\nthe Achaeans?\"\\n\\nAnd Priam said, \"Who are you, my friend, and who are your parents, that\\nyou speak so truly about the fate of my unhappy son?\"\\n\\nThe slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, answered him, \"Sir, you would\\nprove me, that you question me about noble Hector. Many a time have I\\nset eyes upon him in battle when he was driving the Argives to their\\nships and putting them to the sword. We stood still and marvelled, for\\nAchilles in his anger with the son of Atreus suffered us not to fight.\\nI am his squire, and came with him in the same ship. I am a Myrmidon,\\nand my father\\'s name is Polyctor: he is a rich man and about as old as\\nyou are; he has six sons besides myself, and I am the seventh. We cast\\nlots, and it fell upon me to sail hither with Achilles. I am now come\\nfrom the ships on to the plain, for with daybreak the Achaeans will set\\nbattle in array about the city. They chafe at doing nothing, and are so\\neager that their princes cannot hold them back.\"\\n\\nThen answered Priam, \"If you are indeed the squire of Achilles son of\\nPeleus, tell me now the whole truth. Is my son still at the ships, or\\nhas Achilles hewn him limb from limb, and given him to his hounds?\"\\n\\n\"Sir,\" replied the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, \"neither hounds\\nnor vultures have yet devoured him; he is still just lying at the tents\\nby the ship of Achilles, and though it is now twelve days that he has\\nlain there, his flesh is not wasted nor have the worms eaten him\\nalthough they feed on warriors. At daybreak Achilles drags him cruelly\\nround the sepulchre of his dear comrade, but it does him no hurt. You\\nshould come yourself and see how he lies fresh as dew, with the blood\\nall washed away, and his wounds every one of them closed though many\\npierced him with their spears. Such care have the blessed gods taken of\\nyour brave son, for he was dear to them beyond all measure.\"\\n\\nThe old man was comforted as he heard him and said, \"My son, see what a\\ngood thing it is to have made due offerings to the immortals; for as\\nsure as that he was born my son never forgot the gods that hold\\nOlympus, and now they requite it to him even in death. Accept therefore\\nat my hands this goodly chalice; guard me and with heaven\\'s help guide\\nme till I come to the tent of the son of Peleus.\"\\n\\nThen answered the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, \"Sir, you are\\ntempting me and playing upon my youth, but you shall not move me, for\\nyou are offering me presents without the knowledge of Achilles whom I\\nfear and hold it great guilt to defraud, lest some evil presently\\nbefall me; but as your guide I would go with you even to Argos itself,\\nand would guard you so carefully whether by sea or land, that no one\\nshould attack you through making light of him who was with you.\"\\n\\nThe bringer of good luck then sprang on to the chariot, and seizing the\\nwhip and reins he breathed fresh spirit into the mules and horses. When\\nthey reached the trench and the wall that was before the ships, those\\nwho were on guard had just been getting their suppers, and the slayer\\nof Argus threw them all into a deep sleep. Then he drew back the bolts\\nto open the gates, and took Priam inside with the treasure he had upon\\nhis waggon. Ere long they came to the lofty dwelling of the son of\\nPeleus for which the Myrmidons had cut pine and which they had built\\nfor their king; when they had built it they thatched it with coarse\\ntussock-grass which they had mown out on the plain, and all round it\\nthey made a large courtyard, which was fenced with stakes set close\\ntogether. The gate was barred with a single bolt of pine which it took\\nthree men to force into its place, and three to draw back so as to open\\nthe gate, but Achilles could draw it by himself. Mercury opened the\\ngate for the old man, and brought in the treasure that he was taking\\nwith him for the son of Peleus. Then he sprang from the chariot on to\\nthe ground and said, \"Sir, it is I, immortal Mercury, that am come with\\nyou, for my father sent me to escort you. I will now leave you, and\\nwill not enter into the presence of Achilles, for it might anger him\\nthat a god should befriend mortal men thus openly. Go you within, and\\nembrace the knees of the son of Peleus: beseech him by his father, his\\nlovely mother, and his son; thus you may move him.\"\\n\\nWith these words Mercury went back to high Olympus. Priam sprang from\\nhis chariot to the ground, leaving Idaeus where he was, in charge of\\nthe mules and horses. The old man went straight into the house where\\nAchilles, loved of the gods, was sitting. There he found him with his\\nmen seated at a distance from him: only two, the hero Automedon, and\\nAlcimus of the race of Mars, were busy in attendance about his person,\\nfor he had but just done eating and drinking, and the table was still\\nthere. King Priam entered without their seeing him, and going right up\\nto Achilles he clasped his knees and kissed the dread murderous hands\\nthat had slain so many of his sons.\\n\\nAs when some cruel spite has befallen a man that he should have killed\\nsome one in his own country, and must fly to a great man\\'s protection\\nin a land of strangers, and all marvel who see him, even so did\\nAchilles marvel as he beheld Priam. The others looked one to another\\nand marvelled also, but Priam besought Achilles saying, \"Think of your\\nfather, O Achilles like unto the gods, who is such even as I am, on the\\nsad threshold of old age. It may be that those who dwell near him\\nharass him, and there is none to keep war and ruin from him. Yet when\\nhe hears of you being still alive, he is glad, and his days are full of\\nhope that he shall see his dear son come home to him from Troy; but I,\\nwretched man that I am, had the bravest in all Troy for my sons, and\\nthere is not one of them left. I had fifty sons when the Achaeans came\\nhere; nineteen of them were from a single womb, and the others were\\nborne to me by the women of my household. The greater part of them has\\nfierce Mars laid low, and Hector, him who was alone left, him who was\\nthe guardian of the city and ourselves, him have you lately slain;\\ntherefore I am now come to the ships of the Achaeans to ransom his body\\nfrom you with a great ransom. Fear, O Achilles, the wrath of heaven;\\nthink on your own father and have compassion upon me, who am the more\\npitiable, for I have steeled myself as no man yet has ever steeled\\nhimself before me, and have raised to my lips the hand of him who slew\\nmy son.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Priam, and the heart of Achilles yearned as he bethought him\\nof his father. He took the old man\\'s hand and moved him gently away.\\nThe two wept bitterly--Priam, as he lay at Achilles\\' feet, weeping for\\nHector, and Achilles now for his father and now for Patroclus, till the\\nhouse was filled with their lamentation. But when Achilles was now\\nsated with grief and had unburthened the bitterness of his sorrow, he\\nleft his seat and raised the old man by the hand, in pity for his white\\nhair and beard; then he said, \"Unhappy man, you have indeed been\\ngreatly daring; how could you venture to come alone to the ships of the\\nAchaeans, and enter the presence of him who has slain so many of your\\nbrave sons? You must have iron courage: sit now upon this seat, and for\\nall our grief we will hide our sorrows in our hearts, for weeping will\\nnot avail us. The immortals know no care, yet the lot they spin for man\\nis full of sorrow; on the floor of Jove\\'s palace there stand two urns,\\nthe one filled with evil gifts, and the other with good ones. He for\\nwhom Jove the lord of thunder mixes the gifts he sends, will meet now\\nwith good and now with evil fortune; but he to whom Jove sends none but\\nevil gifts will be pointed at by the finger of scorn, the hand of\\nfamine will pursue him to the ends of the world, and he will go up and\\ndown the face of the earth, respected neither by gods nor men. Even so\\ndid it befall Peleus; the gods endowed him with all good things from\\nhis birth upwards, for he reigned over the Myrmidons excelling all men\\nin prosperity and wealth, and mortal though he was they gave him a\\ngoddess for his bride. But even on him too did heaven send misfortune,\\nfor there is no race of royal children born to him in his house, save\\none son who is doomed to die all untimely; nor may I take care of him\\nnow that he is growing old, for I must stay here at Troy to be the bane\\nof you and your children. And you too, O Priam, I have heard that you\\nwere aforetime happy. They say that in wealth and plenitude of\\noffspring you surpassed all that is in Lesbos, the realm of Makar to\\nthe northward, Phrygia that is more inland, and those that dwell upon\\nthe great Hellespont; but from the day when the dwellers in heaven sent\\nthis evil upon you, war and slaughter have been about your city\\ncontinually. Bear up against it, and let there be some intervals in\\nyour sorrow. Mourn as you may for your brave son, you will take nothing\\nby it. You cannot raise him from the dead, ere you do so yet another\\nsorrow shall befall you.\"\\n\\nAnd Priam answered, \"O king, bid me not be seated, while Hector is\\nstill lying uncared for in your tents, but accept the great ransom\\nwhich I have brought you, and give him to me at once that I may look\\nupon him. May you prosper with the ransom and reach your own land in\\nsafety, seeing that you have suffered me to live and to look upon the\\nlight of the sun.\"\\n\\nAchilles looked at him sternly and said, \"Vex me, sir, no longer; I am\\nof myself minded to give up the body of Hector. My mother, daughter of\\nthe old man of the sea, came to me from Jove to bid me deliver it to\\nyou. Moreover I know well, O Priam, and you cannot hide it, that some\\ngod has brought you to the ships of the Achaeans, for else, no man\\nhowever strong and in his prime would dare to come to our host; he\\ncould neither pass our guard unseen, nor draw the bolt of my gates thus\\neasily; therefore, provoke me no further, lest I sin against the word\\nof Jove, and suffer you not, suppliant though you are, within my tents.\"\\n\\nThe old man feared him and obeyed. Then the son of Peleus sprang like a\\nlion through the door of his house, not alone, but with him went his\\ntwo squires Automedon and Alcimus who were closer to him than any\\nothers of his comrades now that Patroclus was no more. These unyoked\\nthe horses and mules, and bade Priam\\'s herald and attendant be seated\\nwithin the house. They lifted the ransom for Hector\\'s body from the\\nwaggon, but they left two mantles and a goodly shirt, that Achilles\\nmight wrap the body in them when he gave it to be taken home. Then he\\ncalled to his servants and ordered them to wash the body and anoint it,\\nbut he first took it to a place where Priam should not see it, lest if\\nhe did so, he should break out in the bitterness of his grief, and\\nenrage Achilles, who might then kill him and sin against the word of\\nJove. When the servants had washed the body and anointed it, and had\\nwrapped it in a fair shirt and mantle, Achilles himself lifted it on to\\na bier, and he and his men then laid it on the waggon. He cried aloud\\nas he did so and called on the name of his dear comrade, \"Be not angry\\nwith me, Patroclus,\" he said, \"if you hear even in the house of Hades\\nthat I have given Hector to his father for a ransom. It has been no\\nunworthy one, and I will share it equitably with you.\"\\n\\nAchilles then went back into the tent and took his place on the richly\\ninlaid seat from which he had risen, by the wall that was at right\\nangles to the one against which Priam was sitting. \"Sir,\" he said,\\n\"your son is now laid upon his bier and is ransomed according to\\ndesire; you shall look upon him when you take him away at daybreak; for\\nthe present let us prepare our supper. Even lovely Niobe had to think\\nabout eating, though her twelve children--six daughters and six lusty\\nsons--had been all slain in her house. Apollo killed the sons with\\narrows from his silver bow, to punish Niobe, and Diana slew the\\ndaughters, because Niobe had vaunted herself against Leto; she said\\nLeto had borne two children only, whereas she had herself borne\\nmany--whereon the two killed the many. Nine days did they lie\\nweltering, and there was none to bury them, for the son of Saturn\\nturned the people into stone; but on the tenth day the gods in heaven\\nthemselves buried them, and Niobe then took food, being worn out with\\nweeping. They say that somewhere among the rocks on the mountain\\npastures of Sipylus, where the nymphs live that haunt the river\\nAchelous, there, they say, she lives in stone and still nurses the\\nsorrows sent upon her by the hand of heaven. Therefore, noble sir, let\\nus two now take food; you can weep for your dear son hereafter as you\\nare bearing him back to Ilius--and many a tear will he cost you.\"\\n\\nWith this Achilles sprang from his seat and killed a sheep of silvery\\nwhiteness, which his followers skinned and made ready all in due order.\\nThey cut the meat carefully up into smaller pieces, spitted them, and\\ndrew them off again when they were well roasted. Automedon brought\\nbread in fair baskets and served it round the table, while Achilles\\ndealt out the meat, and they laid their hands on the good things that\\nwere before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,\\nPriam, descendant of Dardanus, marvelled at the strength and beauty of\\nAchilles for he was as a god to see, and Achilles marvelled at Priam as\\nhe listened to him and looked upon his noble presence. When they had\\ngazed their fill Priam spoke first. \"And now, O king,\" he said, \"take\\nme to my couch that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of\\nsleep. Never once have my eyes been closed from the day your hands took\\nthe life of my son; I have grovelled without ceasing in the mire of my\\nstable-yard, making moan and brooding over my countless sorrows. Now,\\nmoreover, I have eaten bread and drunk wine; hitherto I have tasted\\nnothing.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke Achilles told his men and the women-servants to set beds in\\nthe room that was in the gatehouse, and make them with good red rugs,\\nand spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for Priam\\nand Idaeus to wear. So the maids went out carrying a torch and got the\\ntwo beds ready in all haste. Then Achilles said laughingly to Priam,\\n\"Dear sir, you shall lie outside, lest some counsellor of those who in\\ndue course keep coming to advise with me should see you here in the\\ndarkness of the flying night, and tell it to Agamemnon. This might\\ncause delay in the delivery of the body. And now tell me and tell me\\ntrue, for how many days would you celebrate the funeral rites of noble\\nHector? Tell me, that I may hold aloof from war and restrain the host.\"\\n\\nAnd Priam answered, \"Since, then, you suffer me to bury my noble son\\nwith all due rites, do thus, Achilles, and I shall be grateful. You\\nknow how we are pent up within our city; it is far for us to fetch wood\\nfrom the mountain, and the people live in fear. Nine days, therefore,\\nwill we mourn Hector in my house; on the tenth day we will bury him and\\nthere shall be a public feast in his honour; on the eleventh we will\\nbuild a mound over his ashes, and on the twelfth, if there be need, we\\nwill fight.\"\\n\\nAnd Achilles answered, \"All, King Priam, shall be as you have said. I\\nwill stay our fighting for as long a time as you have named.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he laid his hand on the old man\\'s right wrist, in token\\nthat he should have no fear; thus then did Priam and his attendant\\nsleep there in the forecourt, full of thought, while Achilles lay in an\\ninner room of the house, with fair Briseis by his side.\\n\\nAnd now both gods and mortals were fast asleep through the livelong\\nnight, but upon Mercury alone, the bringer of good luck, sleep could\\ntake no hold for he was thinking all the time how to get King Priam\\naway from the ships without his being seen by the strong force of\\nsentinels. He hovered therefore over Priam\\'s head and said, \"Sir, now\\nthat Achilles has spared your life, you seem to have no fear about\\nsleeping in the thick of your foes. You have paid a great ransom, and\\nhave received the body of your son; were you still alive and a prisoner\\nthe sons whom you have left at home would have to give three times as\\nmuch to free you; and so it would be if Agamemnon and the other\\nAchaeans were to know of your being here.\"\\n\\nWhen he heard this the old man was afraid and roused his servant.\\nMercury then yoked their horses and mules, and drove them quickly\\nthrough the host so that no man perceived them. When they came to the\\nford of eddying Xanthus, begotten of immortal Jove, Mercury went back\\nto high Olympus, and dawn in robe of saffron began to break over all\\nthe land. Priam and Idaeus then drove on toward the city lamenting and\\nmaking moan, and the mules drew the body of Hector. No one neither man\\nnor woman saw them, till Cassandra, fair as golden Venus standing on\\nPergamus, caught sight of her dear father in his chariot, and his\\nservant that was the city\\'s herald with him. Then she saw him that was\\nlying upon the bier, drawn by the mules, and with a loud cry she went\\nabout the city saying, \"Come hither Trojans, men and women, and look on\\nHector; if ever you rejoiced to see him coming from battle when he was\\nalive, look now on him that was the glory of our city and all our\\npeople.\"\\n\\nAt this there was not man nor woman left in the city, so great a sorrow\\nhad possessed them. Hard by the gates they met Priam as he was bringing\\nin the body. Hector\\'s wife and his mother were the first to mourn him:\\nthey flew towards the waggon and laid their hands upon his head, while\\nthe crowd stood weeping round them. They would have stayed before the\\ngates, weeping and lamenting the livelong day to the going down of the\\nsun, had not Priam spoken to them from the chariot and said, \"Make way\\nfor the mules to pass you. Afterwards when I have taken the body home\\nyou shall have your fill of weeping.\"\\n\\nOn this the people stood asunder, and made a way for the waggon. When\\nthey had borne the body within the house they laid it upon a bed and\\nseated minstrels round it to lead the dirge, whereon the women joined\\nin the sad music of their lament. Foremost among them all Andromache\\nled their wailing as she clasped the head of mighty Hector in her\\nembrace. \"Husband,\" she cried, \"you have died young, and leave me in\\nyour house a widow; he of whom we are the ill-starred parents is still\\na mere child, and I fear he may not reach manhood. Ere he can do so our\\ncity will be razed and overthrown, for you who watched over it are no\\nmore--you who were its saviour, the guardian of our wives and children.\\nOur women will be carried away captives to the ships, and I among them;\\nwhile you, my child, who will be with me will be put to some unseemly\\ntasks, working for a cruel master. Or, may be, some Achaean will hurl\\nyou (O miserable death) from our walls, to avenge some brother, son, or\\nfather whom Hector slew; many of them have indeed bitten the dust at\\nhis hands, for your father\\'s hand in battle was no light one. Therefore\\ndo the people mourn him. You have left, O Hector, sorrow unutterable to\\nyour parents, and my own grief is greatest of all, for you did not\\nstretch forth your arms and embrace me as you lay dying, nor say to me\\nany words that might have lived with me in my tears night and day for\\nevermore.\"\\n\\nBitterly did she weep the while, and the women joined in her lament.\\nHecuba in her turn took up the strains of woe. \"Hector,\" she cried,\\n\"dearest to me of all my children. So long as you were alive the gods\\nloved you well, and even in death they have not been utterly unmindful\\nof you; for when Achilles took any other of my sons, he would sell him\\nbeyond the seas, to Samos Imbrus or rugged Lemnos; and when he had\\nslain you too with his sword, many a time did he drag you round the\\nsepulchre of his comrade--though this could not give him life--yet here\\nyou lie all fresh as dew, and comely as one whom Apollo has slain with\\nhis painless shafts.\"\\n\\nThus did she too speak through her tears with bitter moan, and then\\nHelen for a third time took up the strain of lamentation. \"Hector,\"\\nsaid she, \"dearest of all my brothers-in-law--for I am wife to\\nAlexandrus who brought me hither to Troy--would that I had died ere he\\ndid so--twenty years are come and gone since I left my home and came\\nfrom over the sea, but I have never heard one word of insult or\\nunkindness from you. When another would chide with me, as it might be\\none of your brothers or sisters or of your brothers\\' wives, or my\\nmother-in-law--for Priam was as kind to me as though he were my own\\nfather--you would rebuke and check them with words of gentleness and\\ngoodwill. Therefore my tears flow both for you and for my unhappy self,\\nfor there is no one else in Troy who is kind to me, but all shrink and\\nshudder as they go by me.\"\\n\\nShe wept as she spoke and the vast crowd that was gathered round her\\njoined in her lament. Then King Priam spoke to them saying, \"Bring\\nwood, O Trojans, to the city, and fear no cunning ambush of the\\nArgives, for Achilles when he dismissed me from the ships gave me his\\nword that they should not attack us until the morning of the twelfth\\nday.\"\\n\\nForthwith they yoked their oxen and mules and gathered together before\\nthe city. Nine days long did they bring in great heaps of wood, and on\\nthe morning of the tenth day with many tears they took brave Hector\\nforth, laid his dead body upon the summit of the pile, and set the fire\\nthereto. Then when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared\\non the eleventh day, the people again assembled, round the pyre of\\nmighty Hector. When they were got together, they first quenched the\\nfire with wine wherever it was burning, and then his brothers and\\ncomrades with many a bitter tear gathered his white bones, wrapped them\\nin soft robes of purple, and laid them in a golden urn, which they\\nplaced in a grave and covered over with large stones set close\\ntogether. Then they built a barrow hurriedly over it keeping guard on\\nevery side lest the Achaeans should attack them before they had\\nfinished. When they had heaped up the barrow they went back again into\\nthe city, and being well assembled they held high feast in the house of\\nPriam their king.\\n\\nThus, then, did they celebrate the funeral of Hector tamer of horses.',\n",
       " 'Book XIX\\n\\nTELEMACHUS AND ULYSSES REMOVE THE ARMOUR--ULYSSES INTERVIEWS\\nPENELOPE--EURYCLEA WASHES HIS FEET AND RECOGNISES THE SCAR ON HIS\\nLEG--PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.\\n\\nUlysses was left in the cloister, pondering on the means whereby with\\nMinerva\\'s help he might be able to kill the suitors. Presently he said\\nto Telemachus, \"Telemachus, we must get the armour together and take\\nit down inside. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you have\\nremoved it. Say that you have taken it to be out of the way of the\\nsmoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses went\\naway, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more\\nparticularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel over\\ntheir wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may disgrace\\nboth banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people\\nto use them.\"\\n\\nTelemachus approved of what his father had said, so he called nurse\\nEuryclea and said, \"Nurse, shut the women up in their room, while I take\\nthe armour that my father left behind him down into the store room. No\\none looks after it now my father is gone, and it has got all smirched\\nwith soot during my own boyhood. I want to take it down where the smoke\\ncannot reach it.\"\\n\\n\"I wish, child,\" answered Euryclea, \"that you would take the management\\nof the house into your own hands altogether, and look after all the\\nproperty yourself. But who is to go with you and light you to the\\nstore-room? The maids would have done so, but you would not let them.\"\\n\\n\"The stranger,\" said Telemachus, \"shall show me a light; when people eat\\nmy bread they must earn it, no matter where they come from.\"\\n\\nEuryclea did as she was told, and bolted the women inside their room.\\nThen Ulysses and his son made all haste to take the helmets, shields,\\nand spears inside; and Minerva went before them with a gold lamp in her\\nhand that shed a soft and brilliant radiance, whereon Telemachus said,\\n\"Father, my eyes behold a great marvel: the walls, with the rafters,\\ncrossbeams, and the supports on which they rest are all aglow as with\\na flaming fire. Surely there is some god here who has come down from\\nheaven.\"\\n\\n\"Hush,\" answered Ulysses, \"hold your peace and ask no questions, for\\nthis is the manner of the gods. Get you to your bed, and leave me here\\nto talk with your mother and the maids. Your mother in her grief will\\nask me all sorts of questions.\"\\n\\nOn this Telemachus went by torch-light to the other side of the inner\\ncourt, to the room in which he always slept. There he lay in his bed\\ntill morning, while Ulysses was left in the cloister pondering on the\\nmeans whereby with Minerva\\'s help he might be able to kill the suitors.\\n\\nThen Penelope came down from her room looking like Venus or Diana, and\\nthey set her a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory near the\\nfire in her accustomed place. It had been made by Icmalius and had a\\nfootstool all in one piece with the seat itself; and it was covered with\\na thick fleece: on this she now sat, and the maids came from the women\\'s\\nroom to join her. They set about removing the tables at which the wicked\\nsuitors had been dining, and took away the bread that was left, with\\nthe cups from which they had drunk. They emptied the embers out of the\\nbraziers, and heaped much wood upon them to give both light and heat;\\nbut Melantho began to rail at Ulysses a second time and said, \"Stranger,\\ndo you mean to plague us by hanging about the house all night and spying\\nupon the women? Be off, you wretch, outside, and eat your supper there,\\nor you shall be driven out with a firebrand.\"\\n\\nUlysses scowled at her and answered, \"My good woman, why should you be\\nso angry with me? Is it because I am not clean, and my clothes are all\\nin rags, and because I am obliged to go begging about after the manner\\nof tramps and beggars generally? I too was a rich man once, and had a\\nfine house of my own; in those days I gave to many a tramp such as I now\\nam, no matter who he might be nor what he wanted. I had any number of\\nservants, and all the other things which people have who live well and\\nare accounted wealthy, but it pleased Jove to take all away from me;\\ntherefore, woman, beware lest you too come to lose that pride and place\\nin which you now wanton above your fellows; have a care lest you get\\nout of favour with your mistress, and lest Ulysses should come home, for\\nthere is still a chance that he may do so. Moreover, though he be dead\\nas you think he is, yet by Apollo\\'s will he has left a son behind him,\\nTelemachus, who will note anything done amiss by the maids in the house,\\nfor he is now no longer in his boyhood.\"\\n\\nPenelope heard what he was saying and scolded the maid, \"Impudent\\nbaggage,\" said she, \"I see how abominably you are behaving, and you\\nshall smart for it. You knew perfectly well, for I told you myself, that\\nI was going to see the stranger and ask him about my husband, for whose\\nsake I am in such continual sorrow.\"\\n\\nThen she said to her head waiting woman Eurynome, \"Bring a seat with a\\nfleece upon it, for the stranger to sit upon while he tells his story,\\nand listens to what I have to say. I wish to ask him some questions.\"\\n\\nEurynome brought the seat at once and set a fleece upon it, and as soon\\nas Ulysses had sat down Penelope began by saying, \"Stranger, I shall\\nfirst ask you who and whence are you? Tell me of your town and parents.\"\\n\\n\"Madam,\" answered Ulysses, \"who on the face of the whole earth can dare\\nto chide with you? Your fame reaches the firmament of heaven itself; you\\nare like some blameless king, who upholds righteousness, as the monarch\\nover a great and valiant nation: the earth yields its wheat and barley,\\nthe trees are loaded with fruit, the ewes bring forth lambs, and the sea\\nabounds with fish by reason of his virtues, and his people do good deeds\\nunder him. Nevertheless, as I sit here in your house, ask me some other\\nquestion and do not seek to know my race and family, or you will recall\\nmemories that will yet more increase my sorrow. I am full of heaviness,\\nbut I ought not to sit weeping and wailing in another person\\'s house,\\nnor is it well to be thus grieving continually. I shall have one of the\\nservants or even yourself complaining of me, and saying that my eyes\\nswim with tears because I am heavy with wine.\"\\n\\nThen Penelope answered, \"Stranger, heaven robbed me of all beauty,\\nwhether of face or figure, when the Argives set sail for Troy and my\\ndear husband with them. If he were to return and look after my affairs\\nI should be both more respected and should show a better presence to\\nthe world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions\\nwhich heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. The chiefs from all our\\nislands--Dulichium, Same, and Zacynthus, as also from Ithaca itself,\\nare wooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. I can therefore\\nshow no attention to strangers, nor suppliants, nor to people who say\\nthat they are skilled artisans, but am all the time broken-hearted\\nabout Ulysses. They want me to marry again at once, and I have to invent\\nstratagems in order to deceive them. In the first place heaven put it in\\nmy mind to set up a great tambour-frame in my room, and to begin\\nworking upon an enormous piece of fine needlework. Then I said to them,\\n\\'Sweethearts, Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not press me to marry\\nagain immediately; wait--for I would not have my skill in needlework\\nperish unrecorded--till I have finished making a pall for the hero\\nLaertes, to be ready against the time when death shall take him. He\\nis very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out\\nwithout a pall.\\' This was what I said, and they assented; whereon I\\nused to keep working at my great web all day long, but at night I would\\nunpick the stitches again by torch light. I fooled them in this way for\\nthree years without their finding it out, but as time wore on and I was\\nnow in my fourth year, in the waning of moons, and many days had been\\naccomplished, those good for nothing hussies my maids betrayed me to the\\nsuitors, who broke in upon me and caught me; they were very angry with\\nme, so I was forced to finish my work whether I would or no. And now\\nI do not see how I can find any further shift for getting out of this\\nmarriage. My parents are putting great pressure upon me, and my son\\nchafes at the ravages the suitors are making upon his estate, for he is\\nnow old enough to understand all about it and is perfectly able to look\\nafter his own affairs, for heaven has blessed him with an excellent\\ndisposition. Still, notwithstanding all this, tell me who you are and\\nwhere you come from--for you must have had father and mother of some\\nsort; you cannot be the son of an oak or of a rock.\"\\n\\nThen Ulysses answered, \"Madam, wife of Ulysses, since you persist in\\nasking me about my family, I will answer, no matter what it costs me:\\npeople must expect to be pained when they have been exiles as long as\\nI have, and suffered as much among as many peoples. Nevertheless, as\\nregards your question I will tell you all you ask. There is a fair and\\nfruitful island in mid-ocean called Crete; it is thickly peopled and\\nthere are ninety cities in it: the people speak many different languages\\nwhich overlap one another, for there are Achaeans, brave Eteocretans,\\nDorians of three-fold race, and noble Pelasgi. There is a great\\ntown there, Cnossus, where Minos reigned who every nine years had a\\nconference with Jove himself. {152} Minos was father to Deucalion, whose\\nson I am, for Deucalion had two sons Idomeneus and myself. Idomeneus\\nsailed for Troy, and I, who am the younger, am called Aethon; my\\nbrother, however, was at once the older and the more valiant of the two;\\nhence it was in Crete that I saw Ulysses and showed him hospitality, for\\nthe winds took him there as he was on his way to Troy, carrying him out\\nof his course from cape Malea and leaving him in Amnisus off the cave of\\nIlithuia, where the harbours are difficult to enter and he could hardly\\nfind shelter from the winds that were then raging. As soon as he got\\nthere he went into the town and asked for Idomeneus, claiming to be his\\nold and valued friend, but Idomeneus had already set sail for Troy some\\nten or twelve days earlier, so I took him to my own house and showed him\\nevery kind of hospitality, for I had abundance of everything. Moreover,\\nI fed the men who were with him with barley meal from the public store,\\nand got subscriptions of wine and oxen for them to sacrifice to their\\nheart\\'s content. They stayed with me twelve days, for there was a gale\\nblowing from the North so strong that one could hardly keep one\\'s feet\\non land. I suppose some unfriendly god had raised it for them, but on\\nthe thirteenth day the wind dropped, and they got away.\"\\n\\nMany a plausible tale did Ulysses further tell her, and Penelope wept\\nas she listened, for her heart was melted. As the snow wastes upon the\\nmountain tops when the winds from South East and West have breathed upon\\nit and thawed it till the rivers run bank full with water, even so did\\nher cheeks overflow with tears for the husband who was all the time\\nsitting by her side. Ulysses felt for her and was sorry for her, but he\\nkept his eyes as hard as horn or iron without letting them so much\\nas quiver, so cunningly did he restrain his tears. Then, when she had\\nrelieved herself by weeping, she turned to him again and said: \"Now,\\nstranger, I shall put you to the test and see whether or no you really\\ndid entertain my husband and his men, as you say you did. Tell me, then,\\nhow he was dressed, what kind of a man he was to look at, and so also\\nwith his companions.\"\\n\\n\"Madam,\" answered Ulysses, \"it is such a long time ago that I can hardly\\nsay. Twenty years are come and gone since he left my home, and went\\nelsewhither; but I will tell you as well as I can recollect. Ulysses\\nwore a mantle of purple wool, double lined, and it was fastened by a\\ngold brooch with two catches for the pin. On the face of this there was\\na device that shewed a dog holding a spotted fawn between his fore paws,\\nand watching it as it lay panting upon the ground. Every one marvelled\\nat the way in which these things had been done in gold, the dog\\nlooking at the fawn, and strangling it, while the fawn was struggling\\nconvulsively to escape. {153} As for the shirt that he wore next his\\nskin, it was so soft that it fitted him like the skin of an onion, and\\nglistened in the sunlight to the admiration of all the women who beheld\\nit. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, that I do not\\nknow whether Ulysses wore these clothes when he left home, or whether\\none of his companions had given them to him while he was on his voyage;\\nor possibly some one at whose house he was staying made him a present\\nof them, for he was a man of many friends and had few equals among the\\nAchaeans. I myself gave him a sword of bronze and a beautiful purple\\nmantle, double lined, with a shirt that went down to his feet, and I\\nsent him on board his ship with every mark of honour. He had a servant\\nwith him, a little older than himself, and I can tell you what he was\\nlike; his shoulders were hunched, {154} he was dark, and he had thick\\ncurly hair. His name was Eurybates, and Ulysses treated him with greater\\nfamiliarity than he did any of the others, as being the most like-minded\\nwith himself.\"\\n\\nPenelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable\\nproofs that Ulysses laid before her; and when she had again found relief\\nin tears she said to him, \"Stranger, I was already disposed to pity you,\\nbut henceforth you shall be honoured and made welcome in my house. It\\nwas I who gave Ulysses the clothes you speak of. I took them out of\\nthe store room and folded them up myself, and I gave him also the gold\\nbrooch to wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall never welcome him home\\nagain. It was by an ill fate that he ever set out for that detested city\\nwhose very name I cannot bring myself even to mention.\"\\n\\nThen Ulysses answered, \"Madam, wife of Ulysses, do not disfigure\\nyourself further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I can\\nhardly blame you for doing so. A woman who has loved her husband and\\nborne him children, would naturally be grieved at losing him, even\\nthough he were a worse man than Ulysses, who they say was like a god.\\nStill, cease your tears and listen to what I can tell you. I will hide\\nnothing from you, and can say with perfect truth that I have lately\\nheard of Ulysses as being alive and on his way home; he is among the\\nThesprotians, and is bringing back much valuable treasure that he has\\nbegged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his crew\\nwere lost as they were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Jove and\\nthe sun-god were angry with him because his men had slaughtered the\\nsun-god\\'s cattle, and they were all drowned to a man. But Ulysses\\nstuck to the keel of the ship and was drifted on to the land of the\\nPhaeacians, who are near of kin to the immortals, and who treated him\\nas though he had been a god, giving him many presents, and wishing to\\nescort him home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have been here\\nlong ago, had he not thought better to go from land to land gathering\\nwealth; for there is no man living who is so wily as he is; there is no\\none can compare with him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me all\\nthis, and he swore to me--making drink-offerings in his house as he did\\nso--that the ship was by the water side and the crew found who would\\ntake Ulysses to his own country. He sent me off first, for there\\nhappened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing\\nisland of Dulichium, but he showed me all the treasure Ulysses had got\\ntogether, and he had enough lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep\\nhis family for ten generations; but the king said Ulysses had gone to\\nDodona that he might learn Jove\\'s mind from the high oak tree, and know\\nwhether after so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly or in\\nsecret. So you may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he is close\\nat hand and cannot remain away from home much longer; nevertheless I\\nwill confirm my words with an oath, and call Jove who is the first and\\nmightiest of all gods to witness, as also that hearth of Ulysses to\\nwhich I have now come, that all I have spoken shall surely come to pass.\\nUlysses will return in this self same year; with the end of this moon\\nand the beginning of the next he will be here.\"\\n\\n\"May it be even so,\" answered Penelope; \"if your words come true you\\nshall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see you\\nshall congratulate you; but I know very well how it will be. Ulysses\\nwill not return, neither will you get your escort hence, for so surely\\nas that Ulysses ever was, there are now no longer any such masters in\\nthe house as he was, to receive honourable strangers or to further them\\non their way home. And now, you maids, wash his feet for him, and make\\nhim a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he may be warm and\\nquiet till morning. Then, at day break wash him and anoint him again,\\nthat he may sit in the cloister and take his meals with Telemachus. It\\nshall be the worse for any one of these hateful people who is uncivil to\\nhim; like it or not, he shall have no more to do in this house. For how,\\nsir, shall you be able to learn whether or no I am superior to others of\\nmy sex both in goodness of heart and understanding, if I let you dine in\\nmy cloisters squalid and ill clad? Men live but for a little season; if\\nthey are hard, and deal hardly, people wish them ill so long as they are\\nalive, and speak contemptuously of them when they are dead, but he that\\nis righteous and deals righteously, the people tell of his praise among\\nall lands, and many shall call him blessed.\"\\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Madam, I have foresworn rugs and blankets from the\\nday that I left the snowy ranges of Crete to go on shipboard. I will\\nlie as I have lain on many a sleepless night hitherto. Night after night\\nhave I passed in any rough sleeping place, and waited for morning. Nor,\\nagain, do I like having my feet washed; I shall not let any of the young\\nhussies about your house touch my feet; but, if you have any old and\\nrespectable woman who has gone through as much trouble as I have, I will\\nallow her to wash them.\"\\n\\nTo this Penelope said, \"My dear sir, of all the guests who ever yet\\ncame to my house there never was one who spoke in all things with such\\nadmirable propriety as you do. There happens to be in the house a most\\nrespectable old woman--the same who received my poor dear husband in\\nher arms the night he was born, and nursed him in infancy. She is\\nvery feeble now, but she shall wash your feet.\" \"Come here,\" said she,\\n\"Euryclea, and wash your master\\'s age-mate; I suppose Ulysses\\' hands and\\nfeet are very much the same now as his are, for trouble ages all of us\\ndreadfully fast.\"\\n\\nOn these words the old woman covered her face with her hands; she began\\nto weep and made lamentation saying, \"My dear child, I cannot think\\nwhatever I am to do with you. I am certain no one was ever more\\ngod-fearing than yourself, and yet Jove hates you. No one in the whole\\nworld ever burned him more thigh bones, nor gave him finer hecatombs\\nwhen you prayed you might come to a green old age yourself and see your\\nson grow up to take after you: yet see how he has prevented you alone\\nfrom ever getting back to your own home. I have no doubt the women in\\nsome foreign palace which Ulysses has got to are gibing at him as all\\nthese sluts here have been gibing at you. I do not wonder at your\\nnot choosing to let them wash you after the manner in which they have\\ninsulted you; I will wash your feet myself gladly enough, as Penelope\\nhas said that I am to do so; I will wash them both for Penelope\\'s\\nsake and for your own, for you have raised the most lively feelings of\\ncompassion in my mind; and let me say this moreover, which pray attend\\nto; we have had all kinds of strangers in distress come here before now,\\nbut I make bold to say that no one ever yet came who was so like Ulysses\\nin figure, voice, and feet as you are.\"\\n\\n\"Those who have seen us both,\" answered Ulysses, \"have always said we\\nwere wonderfully like each other, and now you have noticed it too.\"\\n\\nThen the old woman took the cauldron in which she was going to wash his\\nfeet, and poured plenty of cold water into it, adding hot till the bath\\nwas warm enough. Ulysses sat by the fire, but ere long he turned away\\nfrom the light, for it occurred to him that when the old woman had hold\\nof his leg she would recognise a certain scar which it bore, whereon the\\nwhole truth would come out. And indeed as soon as she began washing her\\nmaster, she at once knew the scar as one that had been given him by\\na wild boar when he was hunting on Mt. Parnassus with his excellent\\ngrandfather Autolycus--who was the most accomplished thief and perjurer\\nin the whole world--and with the sons of Autolycus. Mercury himself had\\nendowed him with this gift, for he used to burn the thigh bones of goats\\nand kids to him, so he took pleasure in his companionship. It happened\\nonce that Autolycus had gone to Ithaca and had found the child of his\\ndaughter just born. As soon as he had done supper Euryclea set the\\ninfant upon his knees and said, \"Autolycus, you must find a name for\\nyour grandson; you greatly wished that you might have one.\"\\n\\n\"Son-in-law and daughter,\" replied Autolycus, \"call the child thus: I\\nam highly displeased with a large number of people in one place and\\nanother, both men and women; so name the child \\'Ulysses,\\' or the child\\nof anger. When he grows up and comes to visit his mother\\'s family on Mt.\\nParnassus, where my possessions lie, I will make him a present and will\\nsend him on his way rejoicing.\"\\n\\nUlysses, therefore, went to Parnassus to get the presents from\\nAutolycus, who with his sons shook hands with him and gave him welcome.\\nHis grandmother Amphithea threw her arms about him, and kissed his head,\\nand both his beautiful eyes, while Autolycus desired his sons to get\\ndinner ready, and they did as he told them. They brought in a five year\\nold bull, flayed it, made it ready and divided it into joints; these\\nthey then cut carefully up into smaller pieces and spitted them; they\\nroasted them sufficiently and served the portions round. Thus through\\nthe livelong day to the going down of the sun they feasted, and every\\nman had his full share so that all were satisfied; but when the sun set\\nand it came on dark, they went to bed and enjoyed the boon of sleep.\\n\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the sons of\\nAutolycus went out with their hounds hunting, and Ulysses went too.\\nThey climbed the wooded slopes of Parnassus and soon reached its breezy\\nupland valleys; but as the sun was beginning to beat upon the fields,\\nfresh-risen from the slow still currents of Oceanus, they came to a\\nmountain dell. The dogs were in front searching for the tracks of the\\nbeast they were chasing, and after them came the sons of Autolycus,\\namong whom was Ulysses, close behind the dogs, and he had a long\\nspear in his hand. Here was the lair of a huge boar among some thick\\nbrushwood, so dense that the wind and rain could not get through it, nor\\ncould the sun\\'s rays pierce it, and the ground underneath lay thick\\nwith fallen leaves. The boar heard the noise of the men\\'s feet, and the\\nhounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up to him, so he rushed\\nfrom his lair, raised the bristles on his neck, and stood at bay with\\nfire flashing from his eyes. Ulysses was the first to raise his spear\\nand try to drive it into the brute, but the boar was too quick for him,\\nand charged him sideways, ripping him above the knee with a gash that\\ntore deep though it did not reach the bone. As for the boar, Ulysses hit\\nhim on the right shoulder, and the point of the spear went right through\\nhim, so that he fell groaning in the dust until the life went out of\\nhim. The sons of Autolycus busied themselves with the carcass of the\\nboar, and bound Ulysses\\' wound; then, after saying a spell to stop the\\nbleeding, they went home as fast as they could. But when Autolycus and\\nhis sons had thoroughly healed Ulysses, they made him some splendid\\npresents, and sent him back to Ithaca with much mutual good will. When\\nhe got back, his father and mother were rejoiced to see him, and asked\\nhim all about it, and how he had hurt himself to get the scar; so he\\ntold them how the boar had ripped him when he was out hunting with\\nAutolycus and his sons on Mt. Parnassus.\\n\\nAs soon as Euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and had well\\nhold of it, she recognised it and dropped the foot at once. The leg fell\\ninto the bath, which rang out and was overturned, so that all the water\\nwas spilt on the ground; Euryclea\\'s eyes between her joy and her grief\\nfilled with tears, and she could not speak, but she caught Ulysses\\nby the beard and said, \"My dear child, I am sure you must be Ulysses\\nhimself, only I did not know you till I had actually touched and handled\\nyou.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as though wanting to tell her\\nthat her dear husband was in the house, but Penelope was unable to\\nlook in that direction and observe what was going on, for Minerva had\\ndiverted her attention; so Ulysses caught Euryclea by the throat with\\nhis right hand and with his left drew her close to him, and said,\\n\"Nurse, do you wish to be the ruin of me, you who nursed me at your own\\nbreast, now that after twenty years of wandering I am at last come to\\nmy own home again? Since it has been borne in upon you by heaven to\\nrecognise me, hold your tongue, and do not say a word about it to any\\none else in the house, for if you do I tell you--and it shall surely\\nbe--that if heaven grants me to take the lives of these suitors, I will\\nnot spare you, though you are my own nurse, when I am killing the other\\nwomen.\"\\n\\n\"My child,\" answered Euryclea, \"what are you talking about? You know\\nvery well that nothing can either bend or break me. I will hold my\\ntongue like a stone or a piece of iron; furthermore let me say, and lay\\nmy saying to your heart, when heaven has delivered the suitors into your\\nhand, I will give you a list of the women in the house who have been\\nill-behaved, and of those who are guiltless.\"\\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"Nurse, you ought not to speak in that way; I am\\nwell able to form my own opinion about one and all of them; hold your\\ntongue and leave everything to heaven.\"\\n\\nAs he said this Euryclea left the cloister to fetch some more water, for\\nthe first had been all spilt; and when she had washed him and anointed\\nhim with oil, Ulysses drew his seat nearer to the fire to warm himself,\\nand hid the scar under his rags. Then Penelope began talking to him and\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"Stranger, I should like to speak with you briefly about another matter.\\nIt is indeed nearly bed time--for those, at least, who can sleep in\\nspite of sorrow. As for myself, heaven has given me a life of such\\nunmeasurable woe, that even by day when I am attending to my duties and\\nlooking after the servants, I am still weeping and lamenting during the\\nwhole time; then, when night comes, and we all of us go to bed, I lie\\nawake thinking, and my heart becomes a prey to the most incessant and\\ncruel tortures. As the dun nightingale, daughter of Pandareus, sings in\\nthe early spring from her seat in shadiest covert hid, and with many\\na plaintive trill pours out the tale how by mishap she killed her own\\nchild Itylus, son of king Zethus, even so does my mind toss and turn in\\nits uncertainty whether I ought to stay with my son here, and safeguard\\nmy substance, my bondsmen, and the greatness of my house, out of regard\\nto public opinion and the memory of my late husband, or whether it is\\nnot now time for me to go with the best of these suitors who are wooing\\nme and making me such magnificent presents. As long as my son was still\\nyoung, and unable to understand, he would not hear of my leaving my\\nhusband\\'s house, but now that he is full grown he begs and prays me to\\ndo so, being incensed at the way in which the suitors are eating up his\\nproperty. Listen, then, to a dream that I have had and interpret it for\\nme if you can. I have twenty geese about the house that eat mash out\\nof a trough, {155} and of which I am exceedingly fond. I dreamed that a\\ngreat eagle came swooping down from a mountain, and dug his curved beak\\ninto the neck of each of them till he had killed them all. Presently\\nhe soared off into the sky, and left them lying dead about the yard;\\nwhereon I wept in my dream till all my maids gathered round me, so\\npiteously was I grieving because the eagle had killed my geese. Then he\\ncame back again, and perching on a projecting rafter spoke to me with\\nhuman voice, and told me to leave off crying. \\'Be of good courage,\\' he\\nsaid, \\'daughter of Icarius; this is no dream, but a vision of good omen\\nthat shall surely come to pass. The geese are the suitors, and I am no\\nlonger an eagle, but your own husband, who am come back to you, and who\\nwill bring these suitors to a disgraceful end.\\' On this I woke, and when\\nI looked out I saw my geese at the trough eating their mash as usual.\"\\n\\n\"This dream, Madam,\" replied Ulysses, \"can admit but of one\\ninterpretation, for had not Ulysses himself told you how it shall be\\nfulfilled? The death of the suitors is portended, and not one single one\\nof them will escape.\"\\n\\nAnd Penelope answered, \"Stranger, dreams are very curious and\\nunaccountable things, and they do not by any means invariably come true.\\nThere are two gates through which these unsubstantial fancies proceed;\\nthe one is of horn, and the other ivory. Those that come through\\nthe gate of ivory are fatuous, but those from the gate of horn mean\\nsomething to those that see them. I do not think, however, that my own\\ndream came through the gate of horn, though I and my son should be most\\nthankful if it proves to have done so. Furthermore I say--and lay my\\nsaying to your heart--the coming dawn will usher in the ill-omened day\\nthat is to sever me from the house of Ulysses, for I am about to hold a\\ntournament of axes. My husband used to set up twelve axes in the court,\\none in front of the other, like the stays upon which a ship is built;\\nhe would then go back from them and shoot an arrow through the whole\\ntwelve. I shall make the suitors try to do the same thing, and whichever\\nof them can string the bow most easily, and send his arrow through all\\nthe twelve axes, him will I follow, and quit this house of my lawful\\nhusband, so goodly and so abounding in wealth. But even so, I doubt not\\nthat I shall remember it in my dreams.\"\\n\\nThen Ulysses answered, \"Madam, wife of Ulysses, you need not defer your\\ntournament, for Ulysses will return ere ever they can string the bow,\\nhandle it how they will, and send their arrows through the iron.\"\\n\\nTo this Penelope said, \"As long, sir, as you will sit here and talk\\nto me, I can have no desire to go to bed. Still, people cannot do\\npermanently without sleep, and heaven has appointed us dwellers on earth\\na time for all things. I will therefore go upstairs and recline upon\\nthat couch which I have never ceased to flood with my tears from the day\\nUlysses set out for the city with a hateful name.\"\\n\\nShe then went upstairs to her own room, not alone, but attended by her\\nmaidens, and when there, she lamented her dear husband till Minerva shed\\nsweet sleep over her eyelids.',\n",
       " 'Book VII\\n\\nRECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.\\n\\nThus, then, did Ulysses wait and pray; but the girl drove on to the\\ntown. When she reached her father\\'s house she drew up at the gateway,\\nand her brothers--comely as the gods--gathered round her, took the mules\\nout of the waggon, and carried the clothes into the house, while she\\nwent to her own room, where an old servant, Eurymedusa of Apeira, lit\\nthe fire for her. This old woman had been brought by sea from Apeira,\\nand had been chosen as a prize for Alcinous because he was king over the\\nPhaeacians, and the people obeyed him as though he were a god. {57}\\nShe had been nurse to Nausicaa, and had now lit the fire for her, and\\nbrought her supper for her into her own room.\\n\\nPresently Ulysses got up to go towards the town; and Minerva shed a\\nthick mist all round him to hide him in case any of the proud Phaeacians\\nwho met him should be rude to him, or ask him who he was. Then, as he\\nwas just entering the town, she came towards him in the likeness of a\\nlittle girl carrying a pitcher. She stood right in front of him, and\\nUlysses said:\\n\\n\"My dear, will you be so kind as to show me the house of king Alcinous?\\nI am an unfortunate foreigner in distress, and do not know one in your\\ntown and country.\"\\n\\nThen Minerva said, \"Yes, father stranger, I will show you the house you\\nwant, for Alcinous lives quite close to my own father. I will go before\\nyou and show the way, but say not a word as you go, and do not look\\nat any man, nor ask him questions; for the people here cannot abide\\nstrangers, and do not like men who come from some other place. They are\\na sea-faring folk, and sail the seas by the grace of Neptune in ships\\nthat glide along like thought, or as a bird in the air.\"\\n\\nOn this she led the way, and Ulysses followed in her steps; but not one\\nof the Phaeacians could see him as he passed through the city in the\\nmidst of them; for the great goddess Minerva in her good will towards\\nhim had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness. He admired their\\nharbours, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls of the city,\\nwhich, with the palisade on top of them, were very striking, and when\\nthey reached the king\\'s house Minerva said:\\n\\n\"This is the house, father stranger, which you would have me show you.\\nYou will find a number of great people sitting at table, but do not be\\nafraid; go straight in, for the bolder a man is the more likely he is to\\ncarry his point, even though he is a stranger. First find the queen. Her\\nname is Arete, and she comes of the same family as her husband Alcinous.\\nThey both descend originally from Neptune, who was father to Nausithous\\nby Periboea, a woman of great beauty. Periboea was the youngest daughter\\nof Eurymedon, who at one time reigned over the giants, but he ruined his\\nill-fated people and lost his own life to boot.\\n\\n\"Neptune, however, lay with his daughter, and she had a son by him, the\\ngreat Nausithous, who reigned over the Phaeacians. Nausithous had two\\nsons Rhexenor and Alcinous; {58} Apollo killed the first of them while\\nhe was still a bridegroom and without male issue; but he left a daughter\\nArete, whom Alcinous married, and honours as no other woman is honoured\\nof all those that keep house along with their husbands.\\n\\n\"Thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by her\\nchildren, by Alcinous himself, and by the whole people, who look upon\\nher as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city, for\\nshe is a thoroughly good woman both in head and heart, and when any\\nwomen are friends of hers, she will help their husbands also to settle\\ntheir disputes. If you can gain her good will, you may have every hope\\nof seeing your friends again, and getting safely back to your home and\\ncountry.\"\\n\\nThen Minerva left Scheria and went away over the sea. She went to\\nMarathon {59} and to the spacious streets of Athens, where she entered\\nthe abode of Erechtheus; but Ulysses went on to the house of Alcinous,\\nand he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching the threshold\\nof bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like that of the sun or\\nmoon. The walls on either side were of bronze from end to end, and the\\ncornice was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, and hung on pillars of\\nsilver that rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel was silver and\\nthe hook of the door was of gold.\\n\\nOn either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan, with\\nhis consummate skill, had fashioned expressly to keep watch over the\\npalace of king Alcinous; so they were immortal and could never grow old.\\nSeats were ranged all along the wall, here and there from one end to the\\nother, with coverings of fine woven work which the women of the house\\nhad made. Here the chief persons of the Phaeacians used to sit and eat\\nand drink, for there was abundance at all seasons; and there were golden\\nfigures of young men with lighted torches in their hands, raised on\\npedestals, to give light by night to those who were at table. There are\\n{60} fifty maid servants in the house, some of whom are always grinding\\nrich yellow grain at the mill, while others work at the loom, or sit and\\nspin, and their shuttles go backwards and forwards like the fluttering\\nof aspen leaves, while the linen is so closely woven that it will turn\\noil. As the Phaeacians are the best sailors in the world, so their women\\nexcel all others in weaving, for Minerva has taught them all manner of\\nuseful arts, and they are very intelligent.\\n\\nOutside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of\\nabout four acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful\\ntrees--pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are\\nluscious figs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor\\nfail all the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so\\nsoft that a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on\\npear, apple on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with the grapes, for\\nthere is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this,\\nthe grapes are being made into raisins; in another part they are being\\ngathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further on\\nhave shed their blossom and are beginning to show fruit, others again\\nare just changing colour. In the furthest part of the ground there are\\nbeautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all the year\\nround. Two streams go through it, the one turned in ducts throughout the\\nwhole garden, while the other is carried under the ground of the outer\\ncourt to the house itself, and the town\\'s people draw water from it.\\nSuch, then, were the splendours with which the gods had endowed the\\nhouse of king Alcinous.\\n\\nSo here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but when he\\nhad looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the\\nprecincts of the house. There he found all the chief people among the\\nPhaeacians making their drink offerings to Mercury, which they always\\ndid the last thing before going away for the night. {61} He went\\nstraight through the court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness\\nin which Minerva had enveloped him, till he reached Arete and King\\nAlcinous; then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen, and at\\nthat moment the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he became\\nvisible. Every one was speechless with surprise at seeing a man there,\\nbut Ulysses began at once with his petition.\\n\\n\"Queen Arete,\" he exclaimed, \"daughter of great Rhexenor, in my distress\\nI humbly pray you, as also your husband and these your guests (whom may\\nheaven prosper with long life and happiness, and may they leave their\\npossessions to their children, and all the honours conferred upon them\\nby the state) to help me home to my own country as soon as possible; for\\nI have been long in trouble and away from my friends.\"\\n\\nThen he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held their\\npeace, till presently the old hero Echeneus, who was an excellent\\nspeaker and an elder among the Phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty\\naddressed them thus:\\n\\n\"Alcinous,\" said he, \"it is not creditable to you that a stranger should\\nbe seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one is waiting to\\nhear what you are about to say; tell him, then, to rise and take a seat\\non a stool inlaid with silver, and bid your servants mix some wine and\\nwater that we may make a drink offering to Jove the lord of thunder,\\nwho takes all well disposed suppliants under his protection; and let\\nthe housekeeper give him some supper, of whatever there may be in the\\nhouse.\"\\n\\nWhen Alcinous heard this he took Ulysses by the hand, raised him from\\nthe hearth, and bade him take the seat of Laodamas, who had been sitting\\nbeside him, and was his favourite son. A maid servant then brought him\\nwater in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for\\nhim to wash his hands, and she drew a clean table beside him; an upper\\nservant brought him bread and offered him many good things of what there\\nwas in the house, and Ulysses ate and drank. Then Alcinous said to one\\nof the servants, \"Pontonous, mix a cup of wine and hand it round that\\nwe may make drink-offerings to Jove the lord of thunder, who is the\\nprotector of all well-disposed suppliants.\"\\n\\nPontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after giving\\nevery man his drink-offering. When they had made their offerings, and\\nhad drunk each as much as he was minded, Alcinous said:\\n\\n\"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. You\\nhave had your supper, so now go home to bed. To-morrow morning I shall\\ninvite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give a sacrificial\\nbanquet in honour of our guest; we can then discuss the question of his\\nescort, and consider how we may at once send him back rejoicing to his\\nown country without trouble or inconvenience to himself, no matter how\\ndistant it may be. We must see that he comes to no harm while on his\\nhomeward journey, but when he is once at home he will have to take\\nthe luck he was born with for better or worse like other people. It is\\npossible, however, that the stranger is one of the immortals who\\nhas come down from heaven to visit us; but in this case the gods\\nare departing from their usual practice, for hitherto they have made\\nthemselves perfectly clear to us when we have been offering them\\nhecatombs. They come and sit at our feasts just like one of our selves,\\nand if any solitary wayfarer happens to stumble upon some one or other\\nof them, they affect no concealment, for we are as near of kin to the\\ngods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants are.\" {62}\\n\\nThen Ulysses said: \"Pray, Alcinous, do not take any such notion into\\nyour head. I have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in body\\nnor mind, and most resemble those among you who are the most afflicted.\\nIndeed, were I to tell you all that heaven has seen fit to lay upon me,\\nyou would say that I was still worse off than they are. Nevertheless,\\nlet me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomach is a very\\nimportunate thing, and thrusts itself on a man\\'s notice no matter how\\ndire is his distress. I am in great trouble, yet it insists that I shall\\neat and drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and dwell only\\non the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves, do as you propose,\\nand at break of day set about helping me to get home. I shall be content\\nto die if I may first once more behold my property, my bondsmen, and all\\nthe greatness of my house.\" {63}\\n\\nThus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that he\\nshould have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then when\\nthey had made their drink offerings, and had drunk each as much as he\\nwas minded they went home to bed every man in his own abode, leaving\\nUlysses in the cloister with Arete and Alcinous while the servants were\\ntaking the things away after supper. Arete was the first to speak,\\nfor she recognised the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that Ulysses\\nwas wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so she said,\\n\"Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question I should like\\nto ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who gave you those clothes? Did\\nyou not say you had come here from beyond the sea?\"\\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"It would be a long story Madam, were I to relate\\nin full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been laid\\nheavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is an island far away\\nin the sea which is called \\'the Ogygian.\\' Here dwells the cunning and\\npowerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas. She lives by herself far\\nfrom all neighbours human or divine. Fortune, however, brought me to\\nher hearth all desolate and alone, for Jove struck my ship with his\\nthunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave comrades were\\ndrowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and was carried\\nhither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last during the\\ndarkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the Ogygian island\\nwhere the great goddess Calypso lives. She took me in and treated me\\nwith the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to make me immortal that I\\nmight never grow old, but she could not persuade me to let her do so.\\n\\n\"I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered the good\\nclothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but at last\\nwhen the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free will,\\neither because Jove had told her she must, or because she had changed\\nher mind. She sent me from her island on a raft, which she provisioned\\nwith abundance of bread and wine. Moreover she gave me good stout\\nclothing, and sent me a wind that blew both warm and fair. Days seven\\nand ten did I sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth I caught sight of\\nthe first outlines of the mountains upon your coast--and glad indeed was\\nI to set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was still much trouble in\\nstore for me, for at this point Neptune would let me go no further, and\\nraised a great storm against me; the sea was so terribly high that I\\ncould no longer keep to my raft, which went to pieces under the fury of\\nthe gale, and I had to swim for it, till wind and current brought me to\\nyour shores.\\n\\n\"There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and the\\nwaves dashed me against the rocks, so I again took to the sea and swam\\non till I came to a river that seemed the most likely landing place, for\\nthere were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then, I\\ngot out of the water and gathered my senses together again. Night was\\ncoming on, so I left the river, and went into a thicket, where I covered\\nmyself all over with leaves, and presently heaven sent me off into a\\nvery deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I slept among the leaves all\\nnight, and through the next day till afternoon, when I woke as the sun\\nwas westering, and saw your daughter\\'s maid servants playing upon the\\nbeach, and your daughter among them looking like a goddess. I besought\\nher aid, and she proved to be of an excellent disposition, much more so\\nthan could be expected from so young a person--for young people are apt\\nto be thoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine, and when she\\nhad had me washed in the river she also gave me the clothes in which you\\nsee me. Now, therefore, though it has pained me to do so, I have told\\nyou the whole truth.\"\\n\\nThen Alcinous said, \"Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter not to\\nbring you on at once to my house along with the maids, seeing that she\\nwas the first person whose aid you asked.\"\\n\\n\"Pray do not scold her,\" replied Ulysses; \"she is not to blame. She did\\ntell me to follow along with the maids, but I was ashamed and afraid,\\nfor I thought you might perhaps be displeased if you saw me. Every human\\nbeing is sometimes a little suspicious and irritable.\"\\n\\n\"Stranger,\" replied Alcinous, \"I am not the kind of man to get angry\\nabout nothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by Father Jove,\\nMinerva, and Apollo, now that I see what kind of person you are, and how\\nmuch you think as I do, I wish you would stay here, marry my daughter,\\nand become my son-in-law. If you will stay I will give you a house and\\nan estate, but no one (heaven forbid) shall keep you here against your\\nown wish, and that you may be sure of this I will attend tomorrow to the\\nmatter of your escort. You can sleep {64} during the whole voyage if you\\nlike, and the men shall sail you over smooth waters either to your own\\nhome, or wherever you please, even though it be a long way further\\noff than Euboea, which those of my people who saw it when they took\\nyellow-haired Rhadamanthus to see Tityus the son of Gaia, tell me is the\\nfurthest of any place--and yet they did the whole voyage in a single day\\nwithout distressing themselves, and came back again afterwards. You\\nwill thus see how much my ships excel all others, and what magnificent\\noarsmen my sailors are.\"\\n\\nThen was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, \"Father Jove, grant that\\nAlcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win an imperishable\\nname among mankind, and at the same time I shall return to my country.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed in the\\nroom that was in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs, and to\\nspread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for Ulysses to\\nwear. The maids thereon went out with torches in their hands, and when\\nthey had made the bed they came up to Ulysses and said, \"Rise, sir\\nstranger, and come with us for your bed is ready,\" and glad indeed was\\nhe to go to his rest.\\n\\nSo Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway; but\\nAlcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his wife by\\nhis side.',\n",
       " 'Book I\\n\\nTHE GODS IN COUNCIL--MINERVA\\'S VISIT TO ITHACA--THE CHALLENGE FROM\\nTELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.\\n\\nTell me, O Muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after\\nhe had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit, and\\nmany were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted;\\nmoreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and\\nbring his men safely home; but do what he might he could not save his\\nmen, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the\\ncattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever\\nreaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, oh daughter of\\nJove, from whatsoever source you may know them.\\n\\nSo now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely\\nhome except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return to his wife\\nand country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got him into\\na large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there came a\\ntime when the gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca; even then,\\nhowever, when he was among his own people, his troubles were not\\nyet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him except\\nNeptune, who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not let him\\nget home.\\n\\nNow Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the world\\'s end,\\nand lie in two halves, the one looking West and the other East. {1} He\\nhad gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was enjoying\\nhimself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house of Olympian\\nJove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that moment he was\\nthinking of Aegisthus, who had been killed by Agamemnon\\'s son Orestes;\\nso he said to the other gods:\\n\\n\"See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing\\nbut their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love to\\nAgamemnon\\'s wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew\\nit would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury to warn him not to do\\neither of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure to take his\\nrevenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. Mercury told him\\nthis in all good will but he would not listen, and now he has paid for\\neverything in full.\"\\n\\nThen Minerva said, \"Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it served\\nAegisthus right, and so it would any one else who does as he did; but\\nAegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that my heart\\nbleeds, when I think of his sufferings in that lonely sea-girt island,\\nfar away, poor man, from all his friends. It is an island covered\\nwith forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a goddess lives there,\\ndaughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after the bottom of the ocean,\\nand carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth asunder. This\\ndaughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses, and keeps trying\\nby every kind of blandishment to make him forget his home, so that he\\nis tired of life, and thinks of nothing but how he may once more see the\\nsmoke of his own chimneys. You, sir, take no heed of this, and yet when\\nUlysses was before Troy did he not propitiate you with many a burnt\\nsacrifice? Why then should you keep on being so angry with him?\"\\n\\nAnd Jove said, \"My child, what are you talking about? How can I forget\\nUlysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth, nor more\\nliberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear\\nin mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses for having\\nblinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to\\nNeptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughter to the sea-king Phorcys; therefore\\nthough he will not kill Ulysses outright, he torments him by preventing\\nhim from getting home. Still, let us lay our heads together and see how\\nwe can help him to return; Neptune will then be pacified, for if we are\\nall of a mind he can hardly stand out against us.\"\\n\\nAnd Minerva said, \"Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, if, then, the\\ngods now mean that Ulysses should get home, we should first send Mercury\\nto the Ogygian island to tell Calypso that we have made up our minds and\\nthat he is to return. In the meantime I will go to Ithaca, to put heart\\ninto Ulysses\\' son Telemachus; I will embolden him to call the Achaeans\\nin assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his mother Penelope, who\\npersist in eating up any number of his sheep and oxen; I will also\\nconduct him to Sparta and to Pylos, to see if he can hear anything about\\nthe return of his dear father--for this will make people speak well of\\nhim.\"\\n\\nSo saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals, imperishable,\\nwith which she can fly like the wind over land or sea; she grasped the\\nredoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, wherewith\\nshe quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her, and down she\\ndarted from the topmost summits of Olympus, whereon forthwith she was\\nin Ithaca, at the gateway of Ulysses\\' house, disguised as a visitor,\\nMentes, chief of the Taphians, and she held a bronze spear in her hand.\\nThere she found the lordly suitors seated on hides of the oxen which\\nthey had killed and eaten, and playing draughts in front of the house.\\nMen-servants and pages were bustling about to wait upon them, some\\nmixing wine with water in the mixing-bowls, some cleaning down the\\ntables with wet sponges and laying them out again, and some cutting up\\ngreat quantities of meat.\\n\\nTelemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting moodily\\namong the suitors thinking about his brave father, and how he would send\\nthem flying out of the house, if he were to come to his own again and\\nbe honoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among them, he\\ncaught sight of Minerva and went straight to the gate, for he was vexed\\nthat a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance. He took her right\\nhand in his own, and bade her give him her spear. \"Welcome,\" said he,\\n\"to our house, and when you have partaken of food you shall tell us what\\nyou have come for.\"\\n\\nHe led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him. When they were\\nwithin he took her spear and set it in the spear-stand against a strong\\nbearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy father, and\\nhe conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which he threw a\\ncloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her feet,{2} and he set\\nanother seat near her for himself, away from the suitors, that she might\\nnot be annoyed while eating by their noise and insolence, and that he\\nmight ask her more freely about his father.\\n\\nA maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and\\npoured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she\\ndrew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread, and\\noffered them many good things of what there was in the house, the carver\\nfetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their\\nside, and a manservant brought them wine and poured it out for them.\\n\\nThen the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and seats.\\n{3} Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids went\\nround with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine\\nand water, and they laid their hands upon the good things that were\\nbefore them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink they wanted\\nmusic and dancing, which are the crowning embellishments of a banquet,\\nso a servant brought a lyre to Phemius, whom they compelled perforce\\nto sing to them. As soon as he touched his lyre and began to sing\\nTelemachus spoke low to Minerva, with his head close to hers that no man\\nmight hear.\\n\\n\"I hope, sir,\" said he, \"that you will not be offended with what I am\\ngoing to say. Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it, and\\nall this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in some\\nwilderness or grinding to powder in the surf. If these men were to see\\nmy father come back to Ithaca they would pray for longer legs rather\\nthan a longer purse, for money would not serve them; but he, alas, has\\nfallen on an ill fate, and even when people do sometimes say that he is\\ncoming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see him again. And now,\\nsir, tell me and tell me true, who you are and where you come from. Tell\\nme of your town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, how your\\ncrew brought you to Ithaca, and of what nation they declared themselves\\nto be--for you cannot have come by land. Tell me also truly, for I want\\nto know, are you a stranger to this house, or have you been here in my\\nfather\\'s time? In the old days we had many visitors for my father went\\nabout much himself.\"\\n\\nAnd Minerva answered, \"I will tell you truly and particularly all about\\nit. I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians. I have\\ncome here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign tongue\\nbeing bound for Temesa {4} with a cargo of iron, and I shall bring back\\ncopper. As for my ship, it lies over yonder off the open country away\\nfrom the town, in the harbour Rheithron {5} under the wooded mountain\\nNeritum. {6} Our fathers were friends before us, as old Laertes will\\ntell you, if you will go and ask him. They say, however, that he never\\ncomes to town now, and lives by himself in the country, faring hardly,\\nwith an old woman to look after him and get his dinner for him, when\\nhe comes in tired from pottering about his vineyard. They told me your\\nfather was at home again, and that was why I came, but it seems the gods\\nare still keeping him back, for he is not dead yet not on the mainland.\\nIt is more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid ocean, or a\\nprisoner among savages who are detaining him against his will. I am no\\nprophet, and know very little about omens, but I speak as it is borne\\nin upon me from heaven, and assure you that he will not be away much\\nlonger; for he is a man of such resource that even though he were in\\nchains of iron he would find some means of getting home again. But tell\\nme, and tell me true, can Ulysses really have such a fine looking fellow\\nfor a son? You are indeed wonderfully like him about the head and eyes,\\nfor we were close friends before he set sail for Troy where the flower\\nof all the Argives went also. Since that time we have never either of us\\nseen the other.\"\\n\\n\"My mother,\" answered Telemachus, \"tells me I am son to Ulysses, but it\\nis a wise child that knows his own father. Would that I were son to one\\nwho had grown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask me, there\\nis no more ill-starred man under heaven than he who they tell me is my\\nfather.\"\\n\\nAnd Minerva said, \"There is no fear of your race dying out yet, while\\nPenelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me true,\\nwhat is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people? What\\nis it all about? Have you some banquet, or is there a wedding in the\\nfamily--for no one seems to be bringing any provisions of his own? And\\nthe guests--how atrociously they are behaving; what riot they make over\\nthe whole house; it is enough to disgust any respectable person who\\ncomes near them.\"\\n\\n\"Sir,\" said Telemachus, \"as regards your question, so long as my father\\nwas here it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their\\ndispleasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more\\nclosely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I could have borne it\\nbetter even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his men before\\nTroy, or had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting\\nwere done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his\\nashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown; but now the\\nstorm-winds have spirited him away we know not whither; he is gone\\nwithout leaving so much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing\\nbut dismay. Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of\\nmy father; heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the\\nchiefs from all our islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island of\\nZacynthus, as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up\\nmy house under the pretext of paying their court to my mother, who\\nwill neither point blank say that she will not marry, {7} nor yet bring\\nmatters to an end; so they are making havoc of my estate, and before\\nlong will do so also with myself.\"\\n\\n\"Is that so?\" exclaimed Minerva, \"then you do indeed want Ulysses home\\nagain. Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple of lances, and if he is\\nthe man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinking and making\\nmerry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascally suitors, were\\nhe to stand once more upon his own threshold. He was then coming from\\nEphyra, where he had been to beg poison for his arrows from Ilus, son of\\nMermerus. Ilus feared the ever-living gods and would not give him any,\\nbut my father let him have some, for he was very fond of him. If Ulysses\\nis the man he then was these suitors will have a short shrift and a\\nsorry wedding.\\n\\n\"But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return,\\nand take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge you\\nto set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take my advice,\\ncall the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow morning--lay your case\\nbefore them, and call heaven to bear you witness. Bid the suitors take\\nthemselves off, each to his own place, and if your mother\\'s mind is set\\non marrying again, let her go back to her father, who will find her\\na husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that so dear a\\ndaughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon you to take\\nthe best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and go in quest\\nof your father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell\\nyou something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some\\nheaven-sent message may direct you. First go to Pylos and ask Nestor;\\nthence go on to Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home last of all\\nthe Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive and on his way home,\\nyou can put up with the waste these suitors will make for yet another\\ntwelve months. If on the other hand you hear of his death, come home at\\nonce, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a barrow\\nto his memory, and make your mother marry again. Then, having done all\\nthis, think it well over in your mind how, by fair means or foul, you\\nmay kill these suitors in your own house. You are too old to plead\\ninfancy any longer; have you not heard how people are singing Orestes\\'\\npraises for having killed his father\\'s murderer Aegisthus? You are a\\nfine, smart looking fellow; show your mettle, then, and make yourself a\\nname in story. Now, however, I must go back to my ship and to my crew,\\nwho will be impatient if I keep them waiting longer; think the matter\\nover for yourself, and remember what I have said to you.\"\\n\\n\"Sir,\" answered Telemachus, \"it has been very kind of you to talk to me\\nin this way, as though I were your own son, and I will do all you tell\\nme; I know you want to be getting on with your voyage, but stay a little\\nlonger till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself. I will then\\ngive you a present, and you shall go on your way rejoicing; I will give\\nyou one of great beauty and value--a keepsake such as only dear friends\\ngive to one another.\"\\n\\nMinerva answered, \"Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my way at\\nonce. As for any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it till\\nI come again, and I will take it home with me. You shall give me a very\\ngood one, and I will give you one of no less value in return.\"\\n\\nWith these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had\\ngiven Telemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever about\\nhis father. He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the\\nstranger had been a god, so he went straight to where the suitors were\\nsitting.\\n\\nPhemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he\\ntold the sad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva had laid\\nupon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his song from\\nher room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase, not alone, but\\nattended by two of her handmaids. When she reached the suitors she stood\\nby one of the bearing posts that supported the roof of the cloisters {8}\\nwith a staid maiden on either side of her. She held a veil, moreover,\\nbefore her face, and was weeping bitterly.\\n\\n\"Phemius,\" she cried, \"you know many another feat of gods and heroes,\\nsuch as poets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these, and\\nlet them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sad tale, for it\\nbreaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost husband whom I\\nmourn ever without ceasing, and whose name was great over all Hellas and\\nmiddle Argos.\" {9}\\n\\n\"Mother,\" answered Telemachus, \"let the bard sing what he has a mind to;\\nbards do not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they, who makes\\nthem, and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to his own good\\npleasure. This fellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated return of\\nthe Danaans, for people always applaud the latest songs most warmly.\\nMake up your mind to it and bear it; Ulysses is not the only man who\\nnever came back from Troy, but many another went down as well as he. Go,\\nthen, within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your\\nloom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for speech is\\nman\\'s matter, and mine above all others {10}--for it is I who am master\\nhere.\"\\n\\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son\\'s saying in\\nher heart. Then, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she\\nmourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes.\\nBut the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters {11},\\nand prayed each one that he might be her bed fellow.\\n\\nThen Telemachus spoke, \"Shameless,\" he cried, \"and insolent suitors, let\\nus feast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for it is a\\nrare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius has; but in\\nthe morning meet me in full assembly that I may give you formal notice\\nto depart, and feast at one another\\'s houses, turn and turn about, at\\nyour own cost. If on the other hand you choose to persist in spunging\\nupon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with you in full,\\nand when you fall in my father\\'s house there shall be no man to avenge\\nyou.\"\\n\\nThe suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at the\\nboldness of his speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, \"The\\ngods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may\\nJove never grant you to be chief in Ithaca as your father was before\\nyou.\"\\n\\nTelemachus answered, \"Antinous, do not chide with me, but, god willing,\\nI will be chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think of\\nfor me? It is no bad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches\\nand honour. Still, now that Ulysses is dead there are many great men in\\nIthaca both old and young, and some other may take the lead among them;\\nnevertheless I will be chief in my own house, and will rule those whom\\nUlysses has won for me.\"\\n\\nThen Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, \"It rests with heaven to\\ndecide who shall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your\\nown house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a man\\nin Ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you. And now, my good fellow,\\nI want to know about this stranger. What country does he come from?\\nOf what family is he, and where is his estate? Has he brought you news\\nabout the return of your father, or was he on business of his own? He\\nseemed a well to do man, but he hurried off so suddenly that he was gone\\nin a moment before we could get to know him.\"\\n\\n\"My father is dead and gone,\" answered Telemachus, \"and even if some\\nrumour reaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed\\nsometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his\\nprophecyings no heed. As for the stranger, he was Mentes, son of\\nAnchialus, chief of the Taphians, an old friend of my father\\'s.\" But in\\nhis heart he knew that it had been the goddess.\\n\\nThe suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the\\nevening; but when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to\\nbed each in his own abode. {12} Telemachus\\'s room was high up in a tower\\n{13} that looked on to the outer court; hither, then, he hied, brooding\\nand full of thought. A good old woman, Euryclea, daughter of Ops,\\nthe son of Pisenor, went before him with a couple of blazing torches.\\nLaertes had bought her with his own money when she was quite young; he\\ngave the worth of twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect to her\\nin his household as he did to his own wedded wife, but he did not take\\nher to his bed for he feared his wife\\'s resentment. {14} She it was who\\nnow lighted Telemachus to his room, and she loved him better than any of\\nthe other women in the house did, for she had nursed him when he was a\\nbaby. He opened the door of his bed room and sat down upon the bed; as\\nhe took off his shirt {15} he gave it to the good old woman, who folded\\nit tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg by his bed side, after\\nwhich she went out, pulled the door to by a silver catch, and drew the\\nbolt home by means of the strap. {16} But Telemachus as he lay covered\\nwith a woollen fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended\\nvoyage and of the counsel that Minerva had given him.',\n",
       " 'BOOK V\\n\\n  The exploits of Diomed, who, though wounded by Pandarus,\\n  continues fighting--He kills Pandarus and wounds AEneas--Venus\\n  rescues AEneas, but being wounded by Diomed, commits him\\n  to the care of Apollo and goes to Olympus, where she is tended\\n  by her mother Dione--Mars encourages the Trojans, and\\n  AEneas returns to the fight cured of his wound--Minerva and\\n  Juno help the Achaeans, and by the advice of the former\\n  Diomed wounds Mars, who returns to Olympus to get cured.\\n\\nThen Pallas Minerva put valour into the heart of Diomed, son of Tydeus,\\nthat he might excel all the other Argives, and cover himself with\\nglory. She made a stream of fire flare from his shield and helmet like\\nthe star that shines most brilliantly in summer after its bath in the\\nwaters of Oceanus--even such a fire did she kindle upon his head and\\nshoulders as she bade him speed into the thickest hurly-burly of the\\nfight.\\n\\nNow there was a certain rich and honourable man among the Trojans,\\npriest of Vulcan, and his name was Dares. He had two sons, Phegeus and\\nIdaeus, both of them skilled in all the arts of war. These two came\\nforward from the main body of Trojans, and set upon Diomed, he being on\\nfoot, while they fought from their chariot. When they were close up to\\none another, Phegeus took aim first, but his spear went over Diomed\\'s\\nleft shoulder without hitting him. Diomed then threw, and his spear\\nsped not in vain, for it hit Phegeus on the breast near the nipple, and\\nhe fell from his chariot. Idaeus did not dare to bestride his brother\\'s\\nbody, but sprang from the chariot and took to flight, or he would have\\nshared his brother\\'s fate; whereon Vulcan saved him by wrapping him in\\na cloud of darkness, that his old father might not be utterly\\noverwhelmed with grief; but the son of Tydeus drove off with the\\nhorses, and bade his followers take them to the ships. The Trojans were\\nscared when they saw the two sons of Dares, one of them in fright and\\nthe other lying dead by his chariot. Minerva, therefore, took Mars by\\nthe hand and said, \"Mars, Mars, bane of men, bloodstained stormer of\\ncities, may we not now leave the Trojans and Achaeans to fight it out,\\nand see to which of the two Jove will vouchsafe the victory? Let us go\\naway, and thus avoid his anger.\"\\n\\nSo saying, she drew Mars out of the battle, and set him down upon the\\nsteep banks of the Scamander. Upon this the Danaans drove the Trojans\\nback, and each one of their chieftains killed his man. First King\\nAgamemnon flung mighty Odius, captain of the Halizoni, from his\\nchariot. The spear of Agamemnon caught him on the broad of his back,\\njust as he was turning in flight; it struck him between the shoulders\\nand went right through his chest, and his armour rang rattling round\\nhim as he fell heavily to the ground.\\n\\nThen Idomeneus killed Phaesus, son of Borus the Meonian, who had come\\nfrom Varne. Mighty Idomeneus speared him on the right shoulder as he\\nwas mounting his chariot, and the darkness of death enshrouded him as\\nhe fell heavily from the car.\\n\\nThe squires of Idomeneus spoiled him of his armour, while Menelaus, son\\nof Atreus, killed Scamandrius the son of Strophius, a mighty huntsman\\nand keen lover of the chase. Diana herself had taught him how to kill\\nevery kind of wild creature that is bred in mountain forests, but\\nneither she nor his famed skill in archery could now save him, for the\\nspear of Menelaus struck him in the back as he was flying; it struck\\nhim between the shoulders and went right through his chest, so that he\\nfell headlong and his armour rang rattling round him.\\n\\nMeriones then killed Phereclus the son of Tecton, who was the son of\\nHermon, a man whose hand was skilled in all manner of cunning\\nworkmanship, for Pallas Minerva had dearly loved him. He it was that\\nmade the ships for Alexandrus, which were the beginning of all\\nmischief, and brought evil alike both on the Trojans and on Alexandrus\\nhimself; for he heeded not the decrees of heaven. Meriones overtook him\\nas he was flying, and struck him on the right buttock. The point of the\\nspear went through the bone into the bladder, and death came upon him\\nas he cried aloud and fell forward on his knees.\\n\\nMeges, moreover, slew Pedaeus, son of Antenor, who, though he was a\\nbastard, had been brought up by Theano as one of her own children, for\\nthe love she bore her husband. The son of Phyleus got close up to him\\nand drove a spear into the nape of his neck: it went under his tongue\\nall among his teeth, so he bit the cold bronze, and fell dead in the\\ndust.\\n\\nAnd Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor, the son of noble\\nDolopion, who had been made priest of the river Scamander, and was\\nhonoured among the people as though he were a god. Eurypylus gave him\\nchase as he was flying before him, smote him with his sword upon the\\narm, and lopped his strong hand from off it. The bloody hand fell to\\nthe ground, and the shades of death, with fate that no man can\\nwithstand, came over his eyes.\\n\\nThus furiously did the battle rage between them. As for the son of\\nTydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the Achaeans or the\\nTrojans. He rushed across the plain like a winter torrent that has\\nburst its barrier in full flood; no dykes, no walls of fruitful\\nvineyards can embank it when it is swollen with rain from heaven, but\\nin a moment it comes tearing onward, and lays many a field waste that\\nmany a strong man\\'s hand has reclaimed--even so were the dense\\nphalanxes of the Trojans driven in rout by the son of Tydeus, and many\\nthough they were, they dared not abide his onslaught.\\n\\nNow when the son of Lycaon saw him scouring the plain and driving the\\nTrojans pell-mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit the front part\\nof his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went right through the\\nmetal and pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass was covered with\\nblood. On this the son of Lycaon shouted in triumph, \"Knights Trojans,\\ncome on; the bravest of the Achaeans is wounded, and he will not hold\\nout much longer if King Apollo was indeed with me when I sped from\\nLycia hither.\"\\n\\nThus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed Diomed, who withdrew\\nand made for the chariot and horses of Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus.\\n\"Dear son of Capaneus,\" said he, \"come down from your chariot, and draw\\nthe arrow out of my shoulder.\"\\n\\nSthenelus sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from the wound,\\nwhereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that had been made\\nin his shirt. Then Diomed prayed, saying, \"Hear me, daughter of\\naegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, if ever you loved my father well and\\nstood by him in the thick of a fight, do the like now by me; grant me\\nto come within a spear\\'s throw of that man and kill him. He has been\\ntoo quick for me and has wounded me; and now he is boasting that I\\nshall not see the light of the sun much longer.\"\\n\\nThus he prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard him; she made his limbs supple\\nand quickened his hands and his feet. Then she went up close to him and\\nsaid, \"Fear not, Diomed, to do battle with the Trojans, for I have set\\nin your heart the spirit of your knightly father Tydeus. Moreover, I\\nhave withdrawn the veil from your eyes, that you know gods and men\\napart. If, then, any other god comes here and offers you battle, do not\\nfight him; but should Jove\\'s daughter Venus come, strike her with your\\nspear and wound her.\"\\n\\nWhen she had said this Minerva went away, and the son of Tydeus again\\ntook his place among the foremost fighters, three times more fierce\\neven than he had been before. He was like a lion that some mountain\\nshepherd has wounded, but not killed, as he is springing over the wall\\nof a sheep-yard to attack the sheep. The shepherd has roused the brute\\nto fury but cannot defend his flock, so he takes shelter under cover of\\nthe buildings, while the sheep, panic-stricken on being deserted, are\\nsmothered in heaps one on top of the other, and the angry lion leaps\\nout over the sheep-yard wall. Even thus did Diomed go furiously about\\namong the Trojans.\\n\\nHe killed Astynous, and Hypeiron shepherd of his people, the one with a\\nthrust of his spear, which struck him above the nipple, the other with\\na sword-cut on the collar-bone, that severed his shoulder from his neck\\nand back. He let both of them lie, and went in pursuit of Abas and\\nPolyidus, sons of the old reader of dreams Eurydamas: they never came\\nback for him to read them any more dreams, for mighty Diomed made an\\nend of them. He then gave chase to Xanthus and Thoon, the two sons of\\nPhaenops, both of them very dear to him, for he was now worn out with\\nage, and begat no more sons to inherit his possessions. But Diomed took\\nboth their lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly, for he\\nnevermore saw them come home from battle alive, and his kinsmen divided\\nhis wealth among themselves.\\n\\nThen he came upon two sons of Priam, Echemmon and Chromius, as they\\nwere both in one chariot. He sprang upon them as a lion fastens on the\\nneck of some cow or heifer when the herd is feeding in a coppice. For\\nall their vain struggles he flung them both from their chariot and\\nstripped the armour from their bodies. Then he gave their horses to his\\ncomrades to take them back to the ships.\\n\\nWhen Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he went through\\nthe fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could find Pandarus.\\nWhen he had found the brave son of Lycaon he said, \"Pandarus, where is\\nnow your bow, your winged arrows, and your renown as an archer, in\\nrespect of which no man here can rival you nor is there any in Lycia\\nthat can beat you? Lift then your hands to Jove and send an arrow at\\nthis fellow who is going so masterfully about, and has done such deadly\\nwork among the Trojans. He has killed many a brave man--unless indeed\\nhe is some god who is angry with the Trojans about their sacrifices,\\nand and has set his hand against them in his displeasure.\"\\n\\nAnd the son of Lycaon answered, \"Aeneas, I take him for none other than\\nthe son of Tydeus. I know him by his shield, the visor of his helmet,\\nand by his horses. It is possible that he may be a god, but if he is\\nthe man I say he is, he is not making all this havoc without heaven\\'s\\nhelp, but has some god by his side who is shrouded in a cloud of\\ndarkness, and who turned my arrow aside when it had hit him. I have\\ntaken aim at him already and hit him on the right shoulder; my arrow\\nwent through the breastpiece of his cuirass; and I made sure I should\\nsend him hurrying to the world below, but it seems that I have not\\nkilled him. There must be a god who is angry with me. Moreover I have\\nneither horse nor chariot. In my father\\'s stables there are eleven\\nexcellent chariots, fresh from the builder, quite new, with cloths\\nspread over them; and by each of them there stand a pair of horses,\\nchamping barley and rye; my old father Lycaon urged me again and again\\nwhen I was at home and on the point of starting, to take chariots and\\nhorses with me that I might lead the Trojans in battle, but I would not\\nlisten to him; it would have been much better if I had done so, but I\\nwas thinking about the horses, which had been used to eat their fill,\\nand I was afraid that in such a great gathering of men they might be\\nill-fed, so I left them at home and came on foot to Ilius armed only\\nwith my bow and arrows. These it seems, are of no use, for I have\\nalready hit two chieftains, the sons of Atreus and of Tydeus, and\\nthough I drew blood surely enough, I have only made them still more\\nfurious. I did ill to take my bow down from its peg on the day I led my\\nband of Trojans to Ilius in Hector\\'s service, and if ever I get home\\nagain to set eyes on my native place, my wife, and the greatness of my\\nhouse, may some one cut my head off then and there if I do not break\\nthe bow and set it on a hot fire--such pranks as it plays me.\"\\n\\nAeneas answered, \"Say no more. Things will not mend till we two go\\nagainst this man with chariot and horses and bring him to a trial of\\narms. Mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses of Tros can\\nspeed hither and thither over the plain in pursuit or flight. If Jove\\nagain vouchsafes glory to the son of Tydeus they will carry us safely\\nback to the city. Take hold, then, of the whip and reins while I stand\\nupon the car to fight, or else do you wait this man\\'s onset while I\\nlook after the horses.\"\\n\\n\"Aeneas,\" replied the son of Lycaon, \"take the reins and drive; if we\\nhave to fly before the son of Tydeus the horses will go better for\\ntheir own driver. If they miss the sound of your voice when they expect\\nit they may be frightened, and refuse to take us out of the fight. The\\nson of Tydeus will then kill both of us and take the horses. Therefore\\ndrive them yourself and I will be ready for him with my spear.\"\\n\\nThey then mounted the chariot and drove full-speed towards the son of\\nTydeus. Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, saw them coming and said to Diomed,\\n\"Diomed, son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, I see two heroes\\nspeeding towards you, both of them men of might the one a skilful\\narcher, Pandarus son of Lycaon, the other, Aeneas, whose sire is\\nAnchises, while his mother is Venus. Mount the chariot and let us\\nretreat. Do not, I pray you, press so furiously forward, or you may get\\nkilled.\"\\n\\nDiomed looked angrily at him and answered: \"Talk not of flight, for I\\nshall not listen to you: I am of a race that knows neither flight nor\\nfear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied. I am in no mind to mount, but\\nwill go against them even as I am; Pallas Minerva bids me be afraid of\\nno man, and even though one of them escape, their steeds shall not take\\nboth back again. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart--if\\nMinerva sees fit to vouchsafe me the glory of killing both, stay your\\nhorses here and make the reins fast to the rim of the chariot; then be\\nsure you spring Aeneas\\' horses and drive them from the Trojan to the\\nAchaean ranks. They are of the stock that great Jove gave to Tros in\\npayment for his son Ganymede, and are the finest that live and move\\nunder the sun. King Anchises stole the blood by putting his mares to\\nthem without Laomedon\\'s knowledge, and they bore him six foals. Four\\nare still in his stables, but he gave the other two to Aeneas. We shall\\nwin great glory if we can take them.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse, but the other two had now driven close up to\\nthem, and the son of Lycaon spoke first. \"Great and mighty son,\" said\\nhe, \"of noble Tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low, so I will now try\\nwith my spear.\"\\n\\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him. It struck the\\nshield of the son of Tydeus; the bronze point pierced it and passed on\\ntill it reached the breastplate. Thereon the son of Lycaon shouted out\\nand said, \"You are hit clean through the belly; you will not stand out\\nfor long, and the glory of the fight is mine.\"\\n\\nBut Diomed all undismayed made answer, \"You have missed, not hit, and\\nbefore you two see the end of this matter one or other of you shall\\nglut tough-shielded Mars with his blood.\"\\n\\nWith this he hurled his spear, and Minerva guided it on to Pandarus\\'s\\nnose near the eye. It went crashing in among his white teeth; the\\nbronze point cut through the root of his tongue, coming out under his\\nchin, and his glistening armour rang rattling round him as he fell\\nheavily to the ground. The horses started aside for fear, and he was\\nreft of life and strength.\\n\\nAeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear, fearing\\nlest the Achaeans should carry off the body. He bestrode it as a lion\\nin the pride of strength, with shield and spear before him and a cry of\\nbattle on his lips resolute to kill the first that should dare face\\nhim. But the son of Tydeus caught up a mighty stone, so huge and great\\nthat as men now are it would take two to lift it; nevertheless he bore\\nit aloft with ease unaided, and with this he struck Aeneas on the groin\\nwhere the hip turns in the joint that is called the \"cup-bone.\" The\\nstone crushed this joint, and broke both the sinews, while its jagged\\nedges tore away all the flesh. The hero fell on his knees, and propped\\nhimself with his hand resting on the ground till the darkness of night\\nfell upon his eyes. And now Aeneas, king of men, would have perished\\nthen and there, had not his mother, Jove\\'s daughter Venus, who had\\nconceived him by Anchises when he was herding cattle, been quick to\\nmark, and thrown her two white arms about the body of her dear son. She\\nprotected him by covering him with a fold of her own fair garment, lest\\nsome Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him.\\n\\nThus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight. But the son of\\nCapaneus was not unmindful of the orders that Diomed had given him. He\\nmade his own horses fast, away from the hurly-burly, by binding the\\nreins to the rim of the chariot. Then he sprang upon Aeneas\\'s horses\\nand drove them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. When he had so\\ndone he gave them over to his chosen comrade Deipylus, whom he valued\\nabove all others as the one who was most like-minded with himself, to\\ntake them on to the ships. He then remounted his own chariot, seized\\nthe reins, and drove with all speed in search of the son of Tydeus.\\n\\nNow the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the Cyprian goddess, spear in\\nhand, for he knew her to be feeble and not one of those goddesses that\\ncan lord it among men in battle like Minerva or Enyo the waster of\\ncities, and when at last after a long chase he caught her up, he flew\\nat her and thrust his spear into the flesh of her delicate hand. The\\npoint tore through the ambrosial robe which the Graces had woven for\\nher, and pierced the skin between her wrist and the palm of her hand,\\nso that the immortal blood, or ichor, that flows in the veins of the\\nblessed gods, came pouring from the wound; for the gods do not eat\\nbread nor drink wine, hence they have no blood such as ours, and are\\nimmortal. Venus screamed aloud, and let her son fall, but Phoebus\\nApollo caught him in his arms, and hid him in a cloud of darkness, lest\\nsome Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him; and\\nDiomed shouted out as he left her, \"Daughter of Jove, leave war and\\nbattle alone, can you not be contented with beguiling silly women? If\\nyou meddle with fighting you will get what will make you shudder at the\\nvery name of war.\"\\n\\nThe goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and Iris, fleet as the\\nwind, drew her from the throng, in pain and with her fair skin all\\nbesmirched. She found fierce Mars waiting on the left of the battle,\\nwith his spear and his two fleet steeds resting on a cloud; whereon she\\nfell on her knees before her brother and implored him to let her have\\nhis horses. \"Dear brother,\" she cried, \"save me, and give me your\\nhorses to take me to Olympus where the gods dwell. I am badly wounded\\nby a mortal, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight even with father\\nJove.\"\\n\\nThus she spoke, and Mars gave her his gold-bedizened steeds. She\\nmounted the chariot sick and sorry at heart, while Iris sat beside her\\nand took the reins in her hand. She lashed her horses on and they flew\\nforward nothing loth, till in a trice they were at high Olympus, where\\nthe gods have their dwelling. There she stayed them, unloosed them from\\nthe chariot, and gave them their ambrosial forage; but Venus flung\\nherself on to the lap of her mother Dione, who threw her arms about her\\nand caressed her, saying, \"Which of the heavenly beings has been\\ntreating you in this way, as though you had been doing something wrong\\nin the face of day?\"\\n\\nAnd laughter-loving Venus answered, \"Proud Diomed, the son of Tydeus,\\nwounded me because I was bearing my dear son Aeneas, whom I love best\\nof all mankind, out of the fight. The war is no longer one between\\nTrojans and Achaeans, for the Danaans have now taken to fighting with\\nthe immortals.\"\\n\\n\"Bear it, my child,\" replied Dione, \"and make the best of it. We\\ndwellers in Olympus have to put up with much at the hands of men, and\\nwe lay much suffering on one another. Mars had to suffer when Otus and\\nEphialtes, children of Aloeus, bound him in cruel bonds, so that he lay\\nthirteen months imprisoned in a vessel of bronze. Mars would have then\\nperished had not fair Eeriboea, stepmother to the sons of Aloeus, told\\nMercury, who stole him away when he was already well-nigh worn out by\\nthe severity of his bondage. Juno, again, suffered when the mighty son\\nof Amphitryon wounded her on the right breast with a three-barbed\\narrow, and nothing could assuage her pain. So, also, did huge Hades,\\nwhen this same man, the son of aegis-bearing Jove, hit him with an\\narrow even at the gates of hell, and hurt him badly. Thereon Hades went\\nto the house of Jove on great Olympus, angry and full of pain; and the\\narrow in his brawny shoulder caused him great anguish till Paeeon\\nhealed him by spreading soothing herbs on the wound, for Hades was not\\nof mortal mould. Daring, head-strong, evildoer who recked not of his\\nsin in shooting the gods that dwell in Olympus. And now Minerva has\\negged this son of Tydeus on against yourself, fool that he is for not\\nreflecting that no man who fights with gods will live long or hear his\\nchildren prattling about his knees when he returns from battle. Let,\\nthen, the son of Tydeus see that he does not have to fight with one who\\nis stronger than you are. Then shall his brave wife Aegialeia, daughter\\nof Adrestus, rouse her whole house from sleep, wailing for the loss of\\nher wedded lord, Diomed the bravest of the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nSo saying, she wiped the ichor from the wrist of her daughter with both\\nhands, whereon the pain left her, and her hand was healed. But Minerva\\nand Juno, who were looking on, began to taunt Jove with their mocking\\ntalk, and Minerva was first to speak. \"Father Jove,\" said she, \"do not\\nbe angry with me, but I think the Cyprian must have been persuading\\nsome one of the Achaean women to go with the Trojans of whom she is so\\nvery fond, and while caressing one or other of them she must have torn\\nher delicate hand with the gold pin of the woman\\'s brooch.\"\\n\\nThe sire of gods and men smiled, and called golden Venus to his side.\\n\"My child,\" said he, \"it has not been given you to be a warrior.\\nAttend, henceforth, to your own delightful matrimonial duties, and\\nleave all this fighting to Mars and to Minerva.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse. But Diomed sprang upon Aeneas, though he knew\\nhim to be in the very arms of Apollo. Not one whit did he fear the\\nmighty god, so set was he on killing Aeneas and stripping him of his\\narmour. Thrice did he spring forward with might and main to slay him,\\nand thrice did Apollo beat back his gleaming shield. When he was coming\\non for the fourth time, as though he were a god, Apollo shouted to him\\nwith an awful voice and said, \"Take heed, son of Tydeus, and draw off;\\nthink not to match yourself against gods, for men that walk the earth\\ncannot hold their own with the immortals.\"\\n\\nThe son of Tydeus then gave way for a little space, to avoid the anger\\nof the god, while Apollo took Aeneas out of the crowd and set him in\\nsacred Pergamus, where his temple stood. There, within the mighty\\nsanctuary, Latona and Diana healed him and made him glorious to behold,\\nwhile Apollo of the silver bow fashioned a wraith in the likeness of\\nAeneas, and armed as he was. Round this the Trojans and Achaeans hacked\\nat the bucklers about one another\\'s breasts, hewing each other\\'s round\\nshields and light hide-covered targets. Then Phoebus Apollo said to\\nMars, \"Mars, Mars, bane of men, blood-stained stormer of cities, can\\nyou not go to this man, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight even\\nwith father Jove, and draw him out of the battle? He first went up to\\nthe Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and afterwards\\nsprang upon me too, as though he were a god.\"\\n\\nHe then took his seat on the top of Pergamus, while murderous Mars went\\nabout among the ranks of the Trojans, cheering them on, in the likeness\\nof fleet Acamas chief of the Thracians. \"Sons of Priam,\" said he, \"how\\nlong will you let your people be thus slaughtered by the Achaeans?\\nWould you wait till they are at the walls of Troy? Aeneas the son of\\nAnchises has fallen, he whom we held in as high honour as Hector\\nhimself. Help me, then, to rescue our brave comrade from the stress of\\nthe fight.\"\\n\\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Then Sarpedon\\nrebuked Hector very sternly. \"Hector,\" said he, \"where is your prowess\\nnow? You used to say that though you had neither people nor allies you\\ncould hold the town alone with your brothers and brothers-in-law. I see\\nnot one of them here; they cower as hounds before a lion; it is we,\\nyour allies, who bear the brunt of the battle. I have come from afar,\\neven from Lycia and the banks of the river Xanthus, where I have left\\nmy wife, my infant son, and much wealth to tempt whoever is needy;\\nnevertheless, I head my Lycian soldiers and stand my ground against any\\nwho would fight me though I have nothing here for the Achaeans to\\nplunder, while you look on, without even bidding your men stand firm in\\ndefence of their wives. See that you fall not into the hands of your\\nfoes as men caught in the meshes of a net, and they sack your fair city\\nforthwith. Keep this before your mind night and day, and beseech the\\ncaptains of your allies to hold on without flinching, and thus put away\\ntheir reproaches from you.\"\\n\\nSo spoke Sarpedon, and Hector smarted under his words. He sprang from\\nhis chariot clad in his suit of armour, and went about among the host\\nbrandishing his two spears, exhorting the men to fight and raising the\\nterrible cry of battle. Then they rallied and again faced the Achaeans,\\nbut the Argives stood compact and firm, and were not driven back. As\\nthe breezes sport with the chaff upon some goodly threshing-floor, when\\nmen are winnowing--while yellow Ceres blows with the wind to sift the\\nchaff from the grain, and the chaff-heaps grow whiter and whiter--even\\nso did the Achaeans whiten in the dust which the horses\\' hoofs raised\\nto the firmament of heaven, as their drivers turned them back to\\nbattle, and they bore down with might upon the foe. Fierce Mars, to\\nhelp the Trojans, covered them in a veil of darkness, and went about\\neverywhere among them, inasmuch as Phoebus Apollo had told him that\\nwhen he saw Pallas Minerva leave the fray he was to put courage into\\nthe hearts of the Trojans--for it was she who was helping the Danaans.\\nThen Apollo sent Aeneas forth from his rich sanctuary, and filled his\\nheart with valour, whereon he took his place among his comrades, who\\nwere overjoyed at seeing him alive, sound, and of a good courage; but\\nthey could not ask him how it had all happened, for they were too busy\\nwith the turmoil raised by Mars and by Strife, who raged insatiably in\\ntheir midst.\\n\\nThe two Ajaxes, Ulysses and Diomed, cheered the Danaans on, fearless of\\nthe fury and onset of the Trojans. They stood as still as clouds which\\nthe son of Saturn has spread upon the mountain tops when there is no\\nair and fierce Boreas sleeps with the other boisterous winds whose\\nshrill blasts scatter the clouds in all directions--even so did the\\nDanaans stand firm and unflinching against the Trojans. The son of\\nAtreus went about among them and exhorted them. \"My friends,\" said he,\\n\"quit yourselves like brave men, and shun dishonour in one another\\'s\\neyes amid the stress of battle. They that shun dishonour more often\\nlive than get killed, but they that fly save neither life nor name.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of those who were in the\\nfront rank, the comrade of Aeneas, Deicoon son of Pergasus, whom the\\nTrojans held in no less honour than the sons of Priam, for he was ever\\nquick to place himself among the foremost. The spear of King Agamemnon\\nstruck his shield and went right through it, for the shield stayed it\\nnot. It drove through his belt into the lower part of his belly, and\\nhis armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\\n\\nThen Aeneas killed two champions of the Danaans, Crethon and\\nOrsilochus. Their father was a rich man who lived in the strong city of\\nPhere and was descended from the river Alpheus, whose broad stream\\nflows through the land of the Pylians. The river begat Orsilochus, who\\nruled over much people and was father to Diocles, who in his turn begat\\ntwin sons, Crethon and Orsilochus, well skilled in all the arts of war.\\nThese, when they grew up, went to Ilius with the Argive fleet in the\\ncause of Menelaus and Agamemnon sons of Atreus, and there they both of\\nthem fell. As two lions whom their dam has reared in the depths of some\\nmountain forest to plunder homesteads and carry off sheep and cattle\\ntill they get killed by the hand of man, so were these two vanquished\\nby Aeneas, and fell like high pine-trees to the ground.\\n\\nBrave Menelaus pitied them in their fall, and made his way to the\\nfront, clad in gleaming bronze and brandishing his spear, for Mars\\negged him on to do so with intent that he should be killed by Aeneas;\\nbut Antilochus the son of Nestor saw him and sprang forward, fearing\\nthat the king might come to harm and thus bring all their labour to\\nnothing; when, therefore Aeneas and Menelaus were setting their hands\\nand spears against one another eager to do battle, Antilochus placed\\nhimself by the side of Menelaus. Aeneas, bold though he was, drew back\\non seeing the two heroes side by side in front of him, so they drew the\\nbodies of Crethon and Orsilochus to the ranks of the Achaeans and\\ncommitted the two poor fellows into the hands of their comrades. They\\nthen turned back and fought in the front ranks.\\n\\nThey killed Pylaemenes peer of Mars, leader of the Paphlagonian\\nwarriors. Menelaus struck him on the collar-bone as he was standing on\\nhis chariot, while Antilochus hit his charioteer and squire Mydon, the\\nson of Atymnius, who was turning his horses in flight. He hit him with\\na stone upon the elbow, and the reins, enriched with white ivory, fell\\nfrom his hands into the dust. Antilochus rushed towards him and struck\\nhim on the temples with his sword, whereon he fell head first from the\\nchariot to the ground. There he stood for a while with his head and\\nshoulders buried deep in the dust--for he had fallen on sandy soil till\\nhis horses kicked him and laid him flat on the ground, as Antilochus\\nlashed them and drove them off to the host of the Achaeans.\\n\\nBut Hector marked them from across the ranks, and with a loud cry\\nrushed towards them, followed by the strong battalions of the Trojans.\\nMars and dread Enyo led them on, she fraught with ruthless turmoil of\\nbattle, while Mars wielded a monstrous spear, and went about, now in\\nfront of Hector and now behind him.\\n\\nDiomed shook with passion as he saw them. As a man crossing a wide\\nplain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some great river\\nrolling swiftly to the sea--he sees its boiling waters and starts back\\nin fear--even so did the son of Tydeus give ground. Then he said to his\\nmen, \"My friends, how can we wonder that Hector wields the spear so\\nwell? Some god is ever by his side to protect him, and now Mars is with\\nhim in the likeness of mortal man. Keep your faces therefore towards\\nthe Trojans, but give ground backwards, for we dare not fight with\\ngods.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke the Trojans drew close up, and Hector killed two men, both\\nin one chariot, Menesthes and Anchialus, heroes well versed in war.\\nAjax son of Telamon pitied them in their fall; he came close up and\\nhurled his spear, hitting Amphius the son of Selagus, a man of great\\nwealth who lived in Paesus and owned much corn-growing land, but his\\nlot had led him to come to the aid of Priam and his sons. Ajax struck\\nhim in the belt; the spear pierced the lower part of his belly, and he\\nfell heavily to the ground. Then Ajax ran towards him to strip him of\\nhis armour, but the Trojans rained spears upon him, many of which fell\\nupon his shield. He planted his heel upon the body and drew out his\\nspear, but the darts pressed so heavily upon him that he could not\\nstrip the goodly armour from his shoulders. The Trojan chieftains,\\nmoreover, many and valiant, came about him with their spears, so that\\nhe dared not stay; great, brave and valiant though he was, they drove\\nhim from them and he was beaten back.\\n\\nThus, then, did the battle rage between them. Presently the strong hand\\nof fate impelled Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules, a man both brave and\\nof great stature, to fight Sarpedon; so the two, son and grandson of\\ngreat Jove, drew near to one another, and Tlepolemus spoke first.\\n\"Sarpedon,\" said he, \"councillor of the Lycians, why should you come\\nskulking here you who are a man of peace? They lie who call you son of\\naegis-bearing Jove, for you are little like those who were of old his\\nchildren. Far other was Hercules, my own brave and lion-hearted father,\\nwho came here for the horses of Laomedon, and though he had six ships\\nonly, and few men to follow him, sacked the city of Ilius and made a\\nwilderness of her highways. You are a coward, and your people are\\nfalling from you. For all your strength, and all your coming from\\nLycia, you will be no help to the Trojans but will pass the gates of\\nHades vanquished by my hand.\"\\n\\nAnd Sarpedon, captain of the Lycians, answered, \"Tlepolemus, your\\nfather overthrew Ilius by reason of Laomedon\\'s folly in refusing\\npayment to one who had served him well. He would not give your father\\nthe horses which he had come so far to fetch. As for yourself, you\\nshall meet death by my spear. You shall yield glory to myself, and your\\nsoul to Hades of the noble steeds.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Sarpedon, and Tlepolemus upraised his spear. They threw at\\nthe same moment, and Sarpedon struck his foe in the middle of his\\nthroat; the spear went right through, and the darkness of death fell\\nupon his eyes. Tlepolemus\\'s spear struck Sarpedon on the left thigh\\nwith such force that it tore through the flesh and grazed the bone, but\\nhis father as yet warded off destruction from him.\\n\\nHis comrades bore Sarpedon out of the fight, in great pain by the\\nweight of the spear that was dragging from his wound. They were in such\\nhaste and stress as they bore him that no one thought of drawing the\\nspear from his thigh so as to let him walk uprightly. Meanwhile the\\nAchaeans carried off the body of Tlepolemus, whereon Ulysses was moved\\nto pity, and panted for the fray as he beheld them. He doubted whether\\nto pursue the son of Jove, or to make slaughter of the Lycian rank and\\nfile; it was not decreed, however, that he should slay the son of Jove;\\nMinerva, therefore, turned him against the main body of the Lycians. He\\nkilled Coeranus, Alastor, Chromius, Alcandrus, Halius, Noemon, and\\nPrytanis, and would have slain yet more, had not great Hector marked\\nhim, and sped to the front of the fight clad in his suit of mail,\\nfilling the Danaans with terror. Sarpedon was glad when he saw him\\ncoming, and besought him, saying, \"Son of Priam, let me not be here to\\nfall into the hands of the Danaans. Help me, and since I may not return\\nhome to gladden the hearts of my wife and of my infant son, let me die\\nwithin the walls of your city.\"\\n\\nHector made him no answer, but rushed onward to fall at once upon the\\nAchaeans and kill many among them. His comrades then bore Sarpedon away\\nand laid him beneath Jove\\'s spreading oak tree. Pelagon, his friend and\\ncomrade, drew the spear out of his thigh, but Sarpedon fainted and a\\nmist came over his eyes. Presently he came to himself again, for the\\nbreath of the north wind as it played upon him gave him new life, and\\nbrought him out of the deep swoon into which he had fallen.\\n\\nMeanwhile the Argives were neither driven towards their ships by Mars\\nand Hector, nor yet did they attack them; when they knew that Mars was\\nwith the Trojans they retreated, but kept their faces still turned\\ntowards the foe. Who, then, was first and who last to be slain by Mars\\nand Hector? They were valiant Teuthras, and Orestes the renowned\\ncharioteer, Trechus the Aetolian warrior, Oenomaus, Helenus the son of\\nOenops, and Oresbius of the gleaming girdle, who was possessed of great\\nwealth, and dwelt by the Cephisian lake with the other Boeotians who\\nlived near him, owners of a fertile country.\\n\\nNow when the goddess Juno saw the Argives thus falling, she said to\\nMinerva, \"Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, the\\npromise we made Menelaus that he should not return till he had sacked\\nthe city of Ilius will be of no effect if we let Mars rage thus\\nfuriously. Let us go into the fray at once.\"\\n\\nMinerva did not gainsay her. Thereon the august goddess, daughter of\\ngreat Saturn, began to harness her gold-bedizened steeds. Hebe with all\\nspeed fitted on the eight-spoked wheels of bronze that were on either\\nside of the iron axle-tree. The felloes of the wheels were of gold,\\nimperishable, and over these there was a tire of bronze, wondrous to\\nbehold. The naves of the wheels were silver, turning round the axle\\nupon either side. The car itself was made with plaited bands of gold\\nand silver, and it had a double top-rail running all round it. From the\\nbody of the car there went a pole of silver, on to the end of which she\\nbound the golden yoke, with the bands of gold that were to go under the\\nnecks of the horses Then Juno put her steeds under the yoke, eager for\\nbattle and the war-cry.\\n\\nMeanwhile Minerva flung her richly embroidered vesture, made with her\\nown hands, on to her father\\'s threshold, and donned the shirt of Jove,\\narming herself for battle. She threw her tasselled aegis about her\\nshoulders, wreathed round with Rout as with a fringe, and on it were\\nStrife, and Strength, and Panic whose blood runs cold; moreover there\\nwas the head of the dread monster Gorgon, grim and awful to behold,\\nportent of aegis-bearing Jove. On her head she set her helmet of gold,\\nwith four plumes, and coming to a peak both in front and behind--decked\\nwith the emblems of a hundred cities; then she stepped into her flaming\\nchariot and grasped the spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, with\\nwhich she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her. Juno\\nlashed the horses on, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they flew\\nopen of their own accord--gates over which the Hours preside, in whose\\nhands are Heaven and Olympus, either to open the dense cloud that hides\\nthem, or to close it. Through these the goddesses drove their obedient\\nsteeds, and found the son of Saturn sitting all alone on the topmost\\nridges of Olympus. There Juno stayed her horses, and spoke to Jove the\\nson of Saturn, lord of all. \"Father Jove,\" said she, \"are you not angry\\nwith Mars for these high doings? how great and goodly a host of the\\nAchaeans he has destroyed to my great grief, and without either right\\nor reason, while the Cyprian and Apollo are enjoying it all at their\\nease and setting this unrighteous madman on to do further mischief. I\\nhope, Father Jove, that you will not be angry if I hit Mars hard, and\\nchase him out of the battle.\"\\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"Set Minerva on to him, for she punishes him more\\noften than any one else does.\"\\n\\nJuno did as he had said. She lashed her horses, and they flew forward\\nnothing loth midway betwixt earth and sky. As far as a man can see when\\nhe looks out upon the sea from some high beacon, so far can the\\nloud-neighing horses of the gods spring at a single bound. When they\\nreached Troy and the place where its two flowing streams Simois and\\nScamander meet, there Juno stayed them and took them from the chariot.\\nShe hid them in a thick cloud, and Simois made ambrosia spring up for\\nthem to eat; the two goddesses then went on, flying like turtledoves in\\ntheir eagerness to help the Argives. When they came to the part where\\nthe bravest and most in number were gathered about mighty Diomed,\\nfighting like lions or wild boars of great strength and endurance,\\nthere Juno stood still and raised a shout like that of brazen-voiced\\nStentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty men together.\\n\"Argives,\" she cried; \"shame on cowardly creatures, brave in semblance\\nonly; as long as Achilles was fighting, if his spear was so deadly that\\nthe Trojans dared not show themselves outside the Dardanian gates, but\\nnow they sally far from the city and fight even at your ships.\"\\n\\nWith these words she put heart and soul into them all, while Minerva\\nsprang to the side of the son of Tydeus, whom she found near his\\nchariot and horses, cooling the wound that Pandarus had given him. For\\nthe sweat caused by the hand that bore the weight of his shield\\nirritated the hurt: his arm was weary with pain, and he was lifting up\\nthe strap to wipe away the blood. The goddess laid her hand on the yoke\\nof his horses and said, \"The son of Tydeus is not such another as his\\nfather. Tydeus was a little man, but he could fight, and rushed madly\\ninto the fray even when I told him not to do so. When he went all\\nunattended as envoy to the city of Thebes among the Cadmeans, I bade\\nhim feast in their houses and be at peace; but with that high spirit\\nwhich was ever present with him, he challenged the youth of the\\nCadmeans, and at once beat them in all that he attempted, so mightily\\ndid I help him. I stand by you too to protect you, and I bid you be\\ninstant in fighting the Trojans; but either you are tired out, or you\\nare afraid and out of heart, and in that case I say that you are no\\ntrue son of Tydeus the son of Oeneus.\"\\n\\nDiomed answered, \"I know you, goddess, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove,\\nand will hide nothing from you. I am not afraid nor out of heart, nor\\nis there any slackness in me. I am only following your own\\ninstructions; you told me not to fight any of the blessed gods; but if\\nJove\\'s daughter Venus came into battle I was to wound her with my\\nspear. Therefore I am retreating, and bidding the other Argives gather\\nin this place, for I know that Mars is now lording it in the field.\"\\n\\n\"Diomed, son of Tydeus,\" replied Minerva, \"man after my own heart, fear\\nneither Mars nor any other of the immortals, for I will befriend you.\\nNay, drive straight at Mars, and smite him in close combat; fear not\\nthis raging madman, villain incarnate, first on one side and then on\\nthe other. But now he was holding talk with Juno and myself, saying he\\nwould help the Argives and attack the Trojans; nevertheless he is with\\nthe Trojans, and has forgotten the Argives.\"\\n\\nWith this she caught hold of Sthenelus and lifted him off the chariot\\non to the ground. In a second he was on the ground, whereupon the\\ngoddess mounted the car and placed herself by the side of Diomed. The\\noaken axle groaned aloud under the burden of the awful goddess and the\\nhero; Pallas Minerva took the whip and reins, and drove straight at\\nMars. He was in the act of stripping huge Periphas, son of Ochesius and\\nbravest of the Aetolians. Bloody Mars was stripping him of his armour,\\nand Minerva donned the helmet of Hades, that he might not see her;\\nwhen, therefore, he saw Diomed, he made straight for him and let\\nPeriphas lie where he had fallen. As soon as they were at close\\nquarters he let fly with his bronze spear over the reins and yoke,\\nthinking to take Diomed\\'s life, but Minerva caught the spear in her\\nhand and made it fly harmlessly over the chariot. Diomed then threw,\\nand Pallas Minerva drove the spear into the pit of Mars\\'s stomach where\\nhis under-girdle went round him. There Diomed wounded him, tearing his\\nfair flesh and then drawing his spear out again. Mars roared as loudly\\nas nine or ten thousand men in the thick of a fight, and the Achaeans\\nand Trojans were struck with panic, so terrible was the cry he raised.\\n\\nAs a dark cloud in the sky when it comes on to blow after heat, even so\\ndid Diomed son of Tydeus see Mars ascend into the broad heavens. With\\nall speed he reached high Olympus, home of the gods, and in great pain\\nsat down beside Jove the son of Saturn. He showed Jove the immortal\\nblood that was flowing from his wound, and spoke piteously, saying,\\n\"Father Jove, are you not angered by such doings? We gods are\\ncontinually suffering in the most cruel manner at one another\\'s hands\\nwhile helping mortals; and we all owe you a grudge for having begotten\\nthat mad termagant of a daughter, who is always committing outrage of\\nsome kind. We other gods must all do as you bid us, but her you neither\\nscold nor punish; you encourage her because the pestilent creature is\\nyour daughter. See how she has been inciting proud Diomed to vent his\\nrage on the immortal gods. First he went up to the Cyprian and wounded\\nher in the hand near her wrist, and then he sprang upon me too as\\nthough he were a god. Had I not run for it I must either have lain\\nthere for long enough in torments among the ghastly corpses, or have\\nbeen eaten alive with spears till I had no more strength left in me.\"\\n\\nJove looked angrily at him and said, \"Do not come whining here, Sir\\nFacing-both-ways. I hate you worst of all the gods in Olympus, for you\\nare ever fighting and making mischief. You have the intolerable and\\nstubborn spirit of your mother Juno: it is all I can do to manage her,\\nand it is her doing that you are now in this plight: still, I cannot\\nlet you remain longer in such great pain; you are my own offspring, and\\nit was by me that your mother conceived you; if, however, you had been\\nthe son of any other god, you are so destructive that by this time you\\nshould have been lying lower than the Titans.\"\\n\\nHe then bade Paeeon heal him, whereon Paeeon spread pain-killing herbs\\nupon his wound and cured him, for he was not of mortal mould. As the\\njuice of the fig-tree curdles milk, and thickens it in a moment though\\nit is liquid, even so instantly did Paeeon cure fierce Mars. Then Hebe\\nwashed him, and clothed him in goodly raiment, and he took his seat by\\nhis father Jove all glorious to behold.\\n\\nBut Juno of Argos and Minerva of Alalcomene, now that they had put a\\nstop to the murderous doings of Mars, went back again to the house of\\nJove.',\n",
       " 'Book IV\\n\\nTHE VISIT TO KING MENELAUS, WHO TELLS HIS STORY--MEANWHILE THE SUITORS\\nIN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.\\n\\nthey reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon, where they drove straight\\nto the abode of Menelaus {36} [and found him in his own house, feasting\\nwith his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of his son, and also of\\nhis daughter, whom he was marrying to the son of that valiant warrior\\nAchilles. He had given his consent and promised her to him while he was\\nstill at Troy, and now the gods were bringing the marriage about; so he\\nwas sending her with chariots and horses to the city of the Myrmidons\\nover whom Achilles\\' son was reigning. For his only son he had found a\\nbride from Sparta, {37} the daughter of Alector. This son, Megapenthes,\\nwas born to him of a bondwoman, for heaven vouchsafed Helen no more\\nchildren after she had borne Hermione, who was fair as golden Venus\\nherself.\\n\\nSo the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and making merry\\nin his house. There was a bard also to sing to them and play his lyre,\\nwhile two tumblers went about performing in the midst of them when the\\nman struck up with his tune.] {38}\\n\\nTelemachus and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate,\\nwhereon Eteoneus servant to Menelaus came out, and as soon as he saw\\nthem ran hurrying back into the house to tell his Master. He went close\\nup to him and said, \"Menelaus, there are some strangers come here, two\\nmen, who look like sons of Jove. What are we to do? Shall we take their\\nhorses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as they best can?\"\\n\\nMenelaus was very angry and said, \"Eteoneus, son of Boethous, you never\\nused to be a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. Take their horses\\nout, of course, and show the strangers in that they may have supper;\\nyou and I have staid often enough at other people\\'s houses before we got\\nback here, where heaven grant that we may rest in peace henceforward.\"\\n\\nSo Eteoneus bustled back and bade the other servants come with him. They\\ntook their sweating steeds from under the yoke, made them fast to the\\nmangers, and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then they leaned\\nthe chariot against the end wall of the courtyard, and led the way into\\nthe house. Telemachus and Pisistratus were astonished when they saw it,\\nfor its splendour was as that of the sun and moon; then, when they had\\nadmired everything to their heart\\'s content, they went into the bath\\nroom and washed themselves.\\n\\nWhen the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, they\\nbrought them woollen cloaks and shirts, and the two took their seats by\\nthe side of Menelaus. A maid-servant brought them water in a beautiful\\ngolden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their\\nhands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought\\nthem bread, and offered them many good things of what there was in the\\nhouse, while the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and\\nset cups of gold by their side.\\n\\nMenelaus then greeted them saying, \"Fall to, and welcome; when you have\\ndone supper I shall ask who you are, for the lineage of such men as\\nyou cannot have been lost. You must be descended from a line of\\nsceptre-bearing kings, for poor people do not have such sons as you\\nare.\"\\n\\nOn this he handed them {39} a piece of fat roast loin, which had been\\nset near him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on the\\ngood things that were before them; as soon as they had had enough to eat\\nand drink, Telemachus said to the son of Nestor, with his head so close\\nthat no one might hear, \"Look, Pisistratus, man after my own heart,\\nsee the gleam of bronze and gold--of amber, {40} ivory, and silver.\\nEverything is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace of Olympian\\nJove. I am lost in admiration.\"\\n\\nMenelaus overheard him and said, \"No one, my sons, can hold his own\\nwith Jove, for his house and everything about him is immortal; but among\\nmortal men--well, there may be another who has as much wealth as I\\nhave, or there may not; but at all events I have travelled much and have\\nundergone much hardship, for it was nearly eight years before I could\\nget home with my fleet. I went to Cyprus, Phoenicia and the Egyptians;\\nI went also to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and the Erembians, and to\\nLibya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are born, and the sheep\\nlamb down three times a year. Every one in that country, whether master\\nor man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and good milk, for the ewes yield\\nall the year round. But while I was travelling and getting great riches\\namong these people, my brother was secretly and shockingly murdered\\nthrough the perfidy of his wicked wife, so that I have no pleasure in\\nbeing lord of all this wealth. Whoever your parents may be they must\\nhave told you about all this, and of my heavy loss in the ruin {41} of a\\nstately mansion fully and magnificently furnished. Would that I had only\\na third of what I now have so that I had stayed at home, and all those\\nwere living who perished on the plain of Troy, far from Argos. I often\\ngrieve, as I sit here in my house, for one and all of them. At times\\nI cry aloud for sorrow, but presently I leave off again, for crying is\\ncold comfort and one soon tires of it. Yet grieve for these as I may,\\nI do so for one man more than for them all. I cannot even think of him\\nwithout loathing both food and sleep, so miserable does he make me, for\\nno one of all the Achaeans worked so hard or risked so much as he did.\\nHe took nothing by it, and has left a legacy of sorrow to myself, for he\\nhas been gone a long time, and we know not whether he is alive or\\ndead. His old father, his long-suffering wife Penelope, and his son\\nTelemachus, whom he left behind him an infant in arms, are plunged in\\ngrief on his account.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Menelaus, and the heart of Telemachus yearned as he bethought\\nhim of his father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heard him thus\\nmentioned, so that he held his cloak before his face with both hands.\\nWhen Menelaus saw this he doubted whether to let him choose his own time\\nfor speaking, or to ask him at once and find what it was all about.\\n\\nWhile he was thus in two minds Helen came down from her high vaulted and\\nperfumed room, looking as lovely as Diana herself. Adraste brought her\\na seat, Alcippe a soft woollen rug while Phylo fetched her the silver\\nwork-box which Alcandra wife of Polybus had given her. Polybus lived in\\nEgyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in the whole world; he gave\\nMenelaus two baths, both of pure silver, two tripods, and ten talents of\\ngold; besides all this, his wife gave Helen some beautiful presents, to\\nwit, a golden distaff, and a silver work box that ran on wheels, with a\\ngold band round the top of it. Phylo now placed this by her side, full\\nof fine spun yarn, and a distaff charged with violet coloured wool was\\nlaid upon the top of it. Then Helen took her seat, put her feet upon the\\nfootstool, and began to question her husband. {42}\\n\\n\"Do we know, Menelaus,\" said she, \"the names of these strangers who\\nhave come to visit us? Shall I guess right or wrong?--but I cannot help\\nsaying what I think. Never yet have I seen either man or woman so like\\nsomebody else (indeed when I look at him I hardly know what to think)\\nas this young man is like Telemachus, whom Ulysses left as a baby behind\\nhim, when you Achaeans went to Troy with battle in your hearts, on\\naccount of my most shameless self.\"\\n\\n\"My dear wife,\" replied Menelaus, \"I see the likeness just as you do.\\nHis hands and feet are just like Ulysses; so is his hair, with the shape\\nof his head and the expression of his eyes. Moreover, when I was talking\\nabout Ulysses, and saying how much he had suffered on my account, tears\\nfell from his eyes, and he hid his face in his mantle.\"\\n\\nThen Pisistratus said, \"Menelaus, son of Atreus, you are right in\\nthinking that this young man is Telemachus, but he is very modest, and\\nis ashamed to come here and begin opening up discourse with one whose\\nconversation is so divinely interesting as your own. My father, Nestor,\\nsent me to escort him hither, for he wanted to know whether you could\\ngive him any counsel or suggestion. A son has always trouble at home\\nwhen his father has gone away leaving him without supporters; and this\\nis how Telemachus is now placed, for his father is absent, and there is\\nno one among his own people to stand by him.\"\\n\\n\"Bless my heart,\" replied Menelaus, \"then I am receiving a visit from\\nthe son of a very dear friend, who suffered much hardship for my sake.\\nI had always hoped to entertain him with most marked distinction when\\nheaven had granted us a safe return from beyond the seas. I should have\\nfounded a city for him in Argos, and built him a house. I should have\\nmade him leave Ithaca with his goods, his son, and all his people, and\\nshould have sacked for them some one of the neighbouring cities that\\nare subject to me. We should thus have seen one another continually,\\nand nothing but death could have interrupted so close and happy an\\nintercourse. I suppose, however, that heaven grudged us such great good\\nfortune, for it has prevented the poor fellow from ever getting home at\\nall.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. Helen wept,\\nTelemachus wept, and so did Menelaus, nor could Pisistratus keep his\\neyes from filling, when he remembered his dear brother Antilochus whom\\nthe son of bright Dawn had killed. Thereon he said to Menelaus,\\n\\n\"Sir, my father Nestor, when we used to talk about you at home, told me\\nyou were a person of rare and excellent understanding. If, then, it be\\npossible, do as I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while I am\\ngetting my supper. Morning will come in due course, and in the forenoon\\nI care not how much I cry for those that are dead and gone. This is all\\nwe can do for the poor things. We can only shave our heads for them and\\nwring the tears from our cheeks. I had a brother who died at Troy; he\\nwas by no means the worst man there; you are sure to have known him--his\\nname was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon him myself, but they say that\\nhe was singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant.\"\\n\\n\"Your discretion, my friend,\" answered Menelaus, \"is beyond your years.\\nIt is plain you take after your father. One can soon see when a man\\nis son to one whom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and\\noffspring--and it has blessed Nestor from first to last all his days,\\ngiving him a green old age in his own house, with sons about him who are\\nboth well disposed and valiant. We will put an end therefore to all this\\nweeping, and attend to our supper again. Let water be poured over our\\nhands. Telemachus and I can talk with one another fully in the morning.\"\\n\\nOn this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their hands\\nand they laid their hands on the good things that were before them.\\n\\nThen Jove\\'s daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She drugged\\nthe wine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, and ill humour.\\nWhoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear all the rest\\nof the day, not even though his father and mother both of them drop down\\ndead, or he sees a brother or a son hewn in pieces before his very eyes.\\nThis drug, of such sovereign power and virtue, had been given to Helen\\nby Polydamna wife of Thon, a woman of Egypt, where there grow all sorts\\nof herbs, some good to put into the mixing bowl and others poisonous.\\nMoreover, every one in the whole country is a skilled physician, for\\nthey are of the race of Paeeon. When Helen had put this drug in the\\nbowl, and had told the servants to serve the wine round, she said:\\n\\n\"Menelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of honourable\\nmen (which is as Jove wills, for he is the giver both of good and evil,\\nand can do what he chooses), feast here as you will, and listen while I\\ntell you a tale in season. I cannot indeed name every single one of the\\nexploits of Ulysses, but I can say what he did when he was before Troy,\\nand you Achaeans were in all sorts of difficulties. He covered himself\\nwith wounds and bruises, dressed himself all in rags, and entered the\\nenemy\\'s city looking like a menial or a beggar, and quite different\\nfrom what he did when he was among his own people. In this disguise\\nhe entered the city of Troy, and no one said anything to him. I alone\\nrecognised him and began to question him, but he was too cunning for me.\\nWhen, however, I had washed and anointed him and had given him clothes,\\nand after I had sworn a solemn oath not to betray him to the Trojans\\ntill he had got safely back to his own camp and to the ships, he told me\\nall that the Achaeans meant to do. He killed many Trojans and got much\\ninformation before he reached the Argive camp, for all which things the\\nTrojan women made lamentation, but for my own part I was glad, for my\\nheart was beginning to yearn after my home, and I was unhappy about\\nthe wrong that Venus had done me in taking me over there, away from\\nmy country, my girl, and my lawful wedded husband, who is indeed by no\\nmeans deficient either in person or understanding.\"\\n\\nThen Menelaus said, \"All that you have been saying, my dear wife, is\\ntrue. I have travelled much, and have had much to do with heroes, but\\nI have never seen such another man as Ulysses. What endurance too,\\nand what courage he displayed within the wooden horse, wherein all the\\nbravest of the Argives were lying in wait to bring death and destruction\\nupon the Trojans. {43} At that moment you came up to us; some god\\nwho wished well to the Trojans must have set you on to it and you had\\nDeiphobus with you. Three times did you go all round our hiding place\\nand pat it; you called our chiefs each by his own name, and mimicked\\nall our wives--Diomed, Ulysses, and I from our seats inside heard what\\na noise you made. Diomed and I could not make up our minds whether to\\nspring out then and there, or to answer you from inside, but Ulysses\\nheld us all in check, so we sat quite still, all except Anticlus, who\\nwas beginning to answer you, when Ulysses clapped his two brawny hands\\nover his mouth, and kept them there. It was this that saved us all, for\\nhe muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took you away again.\"\\n\\n\"How sad,\" exclaimed Telemachus, \"that all this was of no avail to save\\nhim, nor yet his own iron courage. But now, sir, be pleased to send us\\nall to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep.\"\\n\\nOn this Helen told the maid servants to set beds in the room that was in\\nthe gatehouse, and to make them with good red rugs, and spread coverlets\\non the top of them with woollen cloaks for the guests to wear. So\\nthe maids went out, carrying a torch, and made the beds, to which\\na man-servant presently conducted the strangers. Thus, then, did\\nTelemachus and Pisistratus sleep there in the forecourt, while the son\\nof Atreus lay in an inner room with lovely Helen by his side.\\n\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Menelaus rose\\nand dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet,\\ngirded his sword about his shoulders, and left his room looking like an\\nimmortal god. Then, taking a seat near Telemachus he said:\\n\\n\"And what, Telemachus, has led you to take this long sea voyage to\\nLacedaemon? Are you on public, or private business? Tell me all about\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"I have come, sir,\" replied Telemachus, \"to see if you can tell me\\nanything about my father. I am being eaten out of house and home; my\\nfair estate is being wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who keep\\nkilling great numbers of my sheep and oxen, on the pretence of paying\\ntheir addresses to my mother. Therefore, I am suppliant at your knees if\\nhaply you may tell me about my father\\'s melancholy end, whether you saw\\nit with your own eyes, or heard it from some other traveller; for he was\\na man born to trouble. Do not soften things out of any pity for myself,\\nbut tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw. If my brave father\\nUlysses ever did you loyal service either by word or deed, when you\\nAchaeans were harassed by the Trojans, bear it in mind now as in my\\nfavour and tell me truly all.\"\\n\\nMenelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. \"So,\" he exclaimed,\\n\"these cowards would usurp a brave man\\'s bed? A hind might as well lay\\nher new born young in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed in the\\nforest or in some grassy dell: the lion when he comes back to his lair\\nwill make short work with the pair of them--and so will Ulysses with\\nthese suitors. By father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still\\nthe man that he was when he wrestled with Philomeleides in Lesbos, and\\nthrew him so heavily that all the Achaeans cheered him--if he is still\\nsuch and were to come near these suitors, they would have a short shrift\\nand a sorry wedding. As regards your questions, however, I will not\\nprevaricate nor deceive you, but will tell you without concealment all\\nthat the old man of the sea told me.\\n\\n\"I was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt, for\\nmy hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods are very\\nstrict about having their dues. Now off Egypt, about as far as a ship\\ncan sail in a day with a good stiff breeze behind her, there is an\\nisland called Pharos--it has a good harbour from which vessels can\\nget out into open sea when they have taken in water--and here the gods\\nbecalmed me twenty days without so much as a breath of fair wind to help\\nme forward. We should have run clean out of provisions and my men would\\nhave starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon me and saved me in\\nthe person of Idothea, daughter to Proteus, the old man of the sea, for\\nshe had taken a great fancy to me.\\n\\n\"She came to me one day when I was by myself, as I often was, for the\\nmen used to go with their barbed hooks, all over the island in the\\nhope of catching a fish or two to save them from the pangs of hunger.\\n\\'Stranger,\\' said she, \\'it seems to me that you like starving in this\\nway--at any rate it does not greatly trouble you, for you stick here day\\nafter day, without even trying to get away though your men are dying by\\ninches.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Let me tell you,\\' said I, \\'whichever of the goddesses you may happen\\nto be, that I am not staying here of my own accord, but must have\\noffended the gods that live in heaven. Tell me, therefore, for the gods\\nknow everything, which of the immortals it is that is hindering me in\\nthis way, and tell me also how I may sail the sea so as to reach my\\nhome.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Stranger,\\' replied she, \\'I will make it all quite clear to you. There\\nis an old immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts and whose name\\nis Proteus. He is an Egyptian, and people say he is my father; he is\\nNeptune\\'s head man and knows every inch of ground all over the bottom of\\nthe sea. If you can snare him and hold him tight, he will tell you about\\nyour voyage, what courses you are to take, and how you are to sail the\\nsea so as to reach your home. He will also tell you, if you so will, all\\nthat has been going on at your house both good and bad, while you have\\nbeen away on your long and dangerous journey.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Can you show me,\\' said I, \\'some stratagem by means of which I may\\ncatch this old god without his suspecting it and finding me out? For a\\ngod is not easily caught--not by a mortal man.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Stranger,\\' said she, \\'I will make it all quite clear to you. About the\\ntime when the sun shall have reached mid heaven, the old man of the sea\\ncomes up from under the waves, heralded by the West wind that furs the\\nwater over his head. As soon as he has come up he lies down, and goes to\\nsleep in a great sea cave, where the seals--Halosydne\\'s chickens as they\\ncall them--come up also from the grey sea, and go to sleep in shoals\\nall round him; and a very strong and fish-like smell do they bring with\\nthem. {44} Early to-morrow morning I will take you to this place and\\nwill lay you in ambush. Pick out, therefore, the three best men you have\\nin your fleet, and I will tell you all the tricks that the old man will\\nplay you.\\n\\n\"\\'First he will look over all his seals, and count them; then, when he\\nhas seen them and tallied them on his five fingers, he will go to sleep\\namong them, as a shepherd among his sheep. The moment you see that he is\\nasleep seize him; put forth all your strength and hold him fast, for he\\nwill do his very utmost to get away from you. He will turn himself into\\nevery kind of creature that goes upon the earth, and will become also\\nboth fire and water; but you must hold him fast and grip him tighter\\nand tighter, till he begins to talk to you and comes back to what he was\\nwhen you saw him go to sleep; then you may slacken your hold and let him\\ngo; and you can ask him which of the gods it is that is angry with you,\\nand what you must do to reach your home over the seas.\\'\\n\\n\"Having so said she dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to\\nthe place where my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heart was\\nclouded with care as I went along. When I reached my ship we got supper\\nready, for night was falling, and camped down upon the beach.\\n\\n\"When the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, I took the three\\nmen on whose prowess of all kinds I could most rely, and went along by\\nthe sea-side, praying heartily to heaven. Meanwhile the goddess fetched\\nme up four seal skins from the bottom of the sea, all of them just\\nskinned, for she meant playing a trick upon her father. Then she dug\\nfour pits for us to lie in, and sat down to wait till we should come up.\\nWhen we were close to her, she made us lie down in the pits one after\\nthe other, and threw a seal skin over each of us. Our ambuscade would\\nhave been intolerable, for the stench of the fishy seals was most\\ndistressing {45}--who would go to bed with a sea monster if he could\\nhelp it?--but here, too, the goddess helped us, and thought of something\\nthat gave us great relief, for she put some ambrosia under each man\\'s\\nnostrils, which was so fragrant that it killed the smell of the seals.\\n{46}\\n\\n\"We waited the whole morning and made the best of it, watching the seals\\ncome up in hundreds to bask upon the sea shore, till at noon the old man\\nof the sea came up too, and when he had found his fat seals he went over\\nthem and counted them. We were among the first he counted, and he never\\nsuspected any guile, but laid himself down to sleep as soon as he had\\ndone counting. Then we rushed upon him with a shout and seized him; on\\nwhich he began at once with his old tricks, and changed himself first\\ninto a lion with a great mane; then all of a sudden he became a dragon,\\na leopard, a wild boar; the next moment he was running water, and then\\nagain directly he was a tree, but we stuck to him and never lost hold,\\ntill at last the cunning old creature became distressed, and said,\\n\\'Which of the gods was it, Son of Atreus, that hatched this plot with\\nyou for snaring me and seizing me against my will? What do you want?\\'\\n\\n\"\\'You know that yourself, old man,\\' I answered, \\'you will gain nothing\\nby trying to put me off. It is because I have been kept so long in this\\nisland, and see no sign of my being able to get away. I am losing\\nall heart; tell me, then, for you gods know everything, which of the\\nimmortals it is that is hindering me, and tell me also how I may sail\\nthe sea so as to reach my home?\\'\\n\\n\"Then,\\' he said, \\'if you would finish your voyage and get home quickly,\\nyou must offer sacrifices to Jove and to the rest of the gods before\\nembarking; for it is decreed that you shall not get back to your\\nfriends, and to your own house, till you have returned to the heaven-fed\\nstream of Egypt, and offered holy hecatombs to the immortal gods that\\nreign in heaven. When you have done this they will let you finish your\\nvoyage.\\'\\n\\n\"I was broken hearted when I heard that I must go back all that long and\\nterrible voyage to Egypt; {47} nevertheless, I answered, \\'I will do all,\\nold man, that you have laid upon me; but now tell me, and tell me true,\\nwhether all the Achaeans whom Nestor and I left behind us when we set\\nsail from Troy have got home safely, or whether any one of them came\\nto a bad end either on board his own ship or among his friends when the\\ndays of his fighting were done.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Son of Atreus,\\' he answered, \\'why ask me? You had better not know what\\nI can tell you, for your eyes will surely fill when you have heard my\\nstory. Many of those about whom you ask are dead and gone, but many\\nstill remain, and only two of the chief men among the Achaeans\\nperished during their return home. As for what happened on the field of\\nbattle--you were there yourself. A third Achaean leader is still at sea,\\nalive, but hindered from returning. Ajax was wrecked, for Neptune drove\\nhim on to the great rocks of Gyrae; nevertheless, he let him get safe\\nout of the water, and in spite of all Minerva\\'s hatred he would have\\nescaped death, if he had not ruined himself by boasting. He said the\\ngods could not drown him even though they had tried to do so, and when\\nNeptune heard this large talk, he seized his trident in his two brawny\\nhands, and split the rock of Gyrae in two pieces. The base remained\\nwhere it was, but the part on which Ajax was sitting fell headlong\\ninto the sea and carried Ajax with it; so he drank salt water and was\\ndrowned.\\n\\n\"\\'Your brother and his ships escaped, for Juno protected him, but when\\nhe was just about to reach the high promontory of Malea, he was caught\\nby a heavy gale which carried him out to sea again sorely against his\\nwill, and drove him to the foreland where Thyestes used to dwell, but\\nwhere Aegisthus was then living. By and by, however, it seemed as though\\nhe was to return safely after all, for the gods backed the wind into its\\nold quarter and they reached home; whereon Agamemnon kissed his native\\nsoil, and shed tears of joy at finding himself in his own country.\\n\\n\"\\'Now there was a watchman whom Aegisthus kept always on the watch, and\\nto whom he had promised two talents of gold. This man had been looking\\nout for a whole year to make sure that Agamemnon did not give him the\\nslip and prepare war; when, therefore, this man saw Agamemnon go by,\\nhe went and told Aegisthus, who at once began to lay a plot for him. He\\npicked twenty of his bravest warriors and placed them in ambuscade on\\none side the cloister, while on the opposite side he prepared a banquet.\\nThen he sent his chariots and horsemen to Agamemnon, and invited him to\\nthe feast, but he meant foul play. He got him there, all unsuspicious of\\nthe doom that was awaiting him, and killed him when the banquet was\\nover as though he were butchering an ox in the shambles; not one of\\nAgamemnon\\'s followers was left alive, nor yet one of Aegisthus\\', but\\nthey were all killed there in the cloisters.\\'\\n\\n\"Thus spoke Proteus, and I was broken hearted as I heard him. I sat down\\nupon the sands and wept; I felt as though I could no longer bear to live\\nnor look upon the light of the sun. Presently, when I had had my fill of\\nweeping and writhing upon the ground, the old man of the sea said, \\'Son\\nof Atreus, do not waste any more time in crying so bitterly; it can\\ndo no manner of good; find your way home as fast as ever you can,\\nfor Aegisthus may be still alive, and even though Orestes has been\\nbeforehand with you in killing him, you may yet come in for his\\nfuneral.\\'\\n\\n\"On this I took comfort in spite of all my sorrow, and said, \\'I know,\\nthen, about these two; tell me, therefore, about the third man of whom\\nyou spoke; is he still alive, but at sea, and unable to get home? or is\\nhe dead? Tell me, no matter how much it may grieve me.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'The third man,\\' he answered, \\'is Ulysses who dwells in Ithaca. I\\ncan see him in an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph\\nCalypso, who is keeping him prisoner, and he cannot reach his home for\\nhe has no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea. As for your own\\nend, Menelaus, you shall not die in Argos, but the gods will take you to\\nthe Elysian plain, which is at the ends of the world. There fair-haired\\nRhadamanthus reigns, and men lead an easier life than any where else in\\nthe world, for in Elysium there falls not rain, nor hail, nor snow, but\\nOceanus breathes ever with a West wind that sings softly from the sea,\\nand gives fresh life to all men. This will happen to you because you\\nhave married Helen, and are Jove\\'s son-in-law.\\'\\n\\n\"As he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to the\\nships with my companions, and my heart was clouded with care as I went\\nalong. When we reached the ships we got supper ready, for night was\\nfalling, and camped down upon the beach. When the child of morning,\\nrosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we drew our ships into the water, and put\\nour masts and sails within them; then we went on board ourselves, took\\nour seats on the benches, and smote the grey sea with our oars. I\\nagain stationed my ships in the heaven-fed stream of Egypt, and offered\\nhecatombs that were full and sufficient. When I had thus appeased\\nheaven\\'s anger, I raised a barrow to the memory of Agamemnon that his\\nname might live for ever, after which I had a quick passage home, for\\nthe gods sent me a fair wind.\\n\\n\"And now for yourself--stay here some ten or twelve days longer, and I\\nwill then speed you on your way. I will make you a noble present of a\\nchariot and three horses. I will also give you a beautiful chalice\\nthat so long as you live you may think of me whenever you make a\\ndrink-offering to the immortal gods.\"\\n\\n\"Son of Atreus,\" replied Telemachus, \"do not press me to stay longer; I\\nshould be contented to remain with you for another twelve months; I find\\nyour conversation so delightful that I should never once wish myself at\\nhome with my parents; but my crew whom I have left at Pylos are already\\nimpatient, and you are detaining me from them. As for any present you\\nmay be disposed to make me, I had rather that it should be a piece of\\nplate. I will take no horses back with me to Ithaca, but will leave them\\nto adorn your own stables, for you have much flat ground in your kingdom\\nwhere lotus thrives, as also meadow-sweet and wheat and barley, and oats\\nwith their white and spreading ears; whereas in Ithaca we have neither\\nopen fields nor racecourses, and the country is more fit for goats than\\nhorses, and I like it the better for that. {48} None of our islands have\\nmuch level ground, suitable for horses, and Ithaca least of all.\"\\n\\nMenelaus smiled and took Telemachus\\'s hand within his own. \"What you\\nsay,\" said he, \"shows that you come of good family. I both can, and\\nwill, make this exchange for you, by giving you the finest and most\\nprecious piece of plate in all my house. It is a mixing bowl by Vulcan\\'s\\nown hand, of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold.\\nPhaedimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it me in the course of a visit\\nwhich I paid him when I returned thither on my homeward journey. I will\\nmake you a present of it.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse [and guests kept coming to the king\\'s house. They\\nbrought sheep and wine, while their wives had put up bread for them to\\ntake with them; so they were busy cooking their dinners in the courts].\\n{49}\\n\\nMeanwhile the suitors were throwing discs or aiming with spears at\\na mark on the levelled ground in front of Ulysses\\' house, and were\\nbehaving with all their old insolence. Antinous and Eurymachus, who were\\ntheir ringleaders and much the foremost among them all, were sitting\\ntogether when Noemon son of Phronius came up and said to Antinous,\\n\\n\"Have we any idea, Antinous, on what day Telemachus returns from Pylos?\\nHe has a ship of mine, and I want it, to cross over to Elis: I have\\ntwelve brood mares there with yearling mule foals by their side not yet\\nbroken in, and I want to bring one of them over here and break him.\"\\n\\nThey were astounded when they heard this, for they had made sure that\\nTelemachus had not gone to the city of Neleus. They thought he was\\nonly away somewhere on the farms, and was with the sheep, or with the\\nswineherd; so Antinous said, \"When did he go? Tell me truly, and\\nwhat young men did he take with him? Were they freemen or his own\\nbondsmen--for he might manage that too? Tell me also, did you let him\\nhave the ship of your own free will because he asked you, or did he take\\nit without your leave?\"\\n\\n\"I lent it him,\" answered Noemon, \"what else could I do when a man of\\nhis position said he was in a difficulty, and asked me to oblige him? I\\ncould not possibly refuse. As for those who went with him they were the\\nbest young men we have, and I saw Mentor go on board as captain--or some\\ngod who was exactly like him. I cannot understand it, for I saw Mentor\\nhere myself yesterday morning, and yet he was then setting out for\\nPylos.\"\\n\\nNoemon then went back to his father\\'s house, but Antinous and Eurymachus\\nwere very angry. They told the others to leave off playing, and to come\\nand sit down along with themselves. When they came, Antinous son of\\nEupeithes spoke in anger. His heart was black with rage, and his eyes\\nflashed fire as he said:\\n\\n\"Good heavens, this voyage of Telemachus is a very serious matter; we\\nhad made sure that it would come to nothing, but the young fellow has\\ngot away in spite of us, and with a picked crew too. He will be giving\\nus trouble presently; may Jove take him before he is full grown. Find me\\na ship, therefore, with a crew of twenty men, and I will lie in wait for\\nhim in the straits between Ithaca and Samos; he will then rue the day\\nthat he set out to try and get news of his father.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and the others applauded his saying; they then all of\\nthem went inside the buildings.\\n\\nIt was not long ere Penelope came to know what the suitors were\\nplotting; for a man servant, Medon, overheard them from outside the\\nouter court as they were laying their schemes within, and went to tell\\nhis mistress. As he crossed the threshold of her room Penelope said:\\n\"Medon, what have the suitors sent you here for? Is it to tell the maids\\nto leave their master\\'s business and cook dinner for them? I wish they\\nmay neither woo nor dine henceforward, neither here nor anywhere else,\\nbut let this be the very last time, for the waste you all make of my\\nson\\'s estate. Did not your fathers tell you when you were children, how\\ngood Ulysses had been to them--never doing anything high-handed, nor\\nspeaking harshly to anybody? Kings may say things sometimes, and they\\nmay take a fancy to one man and dislike another, but Ulysses never did\\nan unjust thing by anybody--which shows what bad hearts you have, and\\nthat there is no such thing as gratitude left in this world.\"\\n\\nThen Medon said, \"I wish, Madam, that this were all; but they are\\nplotting something much more dreadful now--may heaven frustrate their\\ndesign. They are going to try and murder Telemachus as he is coming home\\nfrom Pylos and Lacedaemon, where he has been to get news of his father.\"\\n\\nThen Penelope\\'s heart sank within her, and for a long time she was\\nspeechless; her eyes filled with tears, and she could find no utterance.\\nAt last, however, she said, \"Why did my son leave me? What business had\\nhe to go sailing off in ships that make long voyages over the ocean like\\nsea-horses? Does he want to die without leaving any one behind him to\\nkeep up his name?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know,\" answered Medon, \"whether some god set him on to it, or\\nwhether he went on his own impulse to see if he could find out if his\\nfather was dead, or alive and on his way home.\"\\n\\nThen he went downstairs again, leaving Penelope in an agony of grief.\\nThere were plenty of seats in the house, but she had no heart for\\nsitting on any one of them; she could only fling herself on the floor of\\nher own room and cry; whereon all the maids in the house, both old\\nand young, gathered round her and began to cry too, till at last in a\\ntransport of sorrow she exclaimed,\\n\\n\"My dears, heaven has been pleased to try me with more affliction\\nthan any other woman of my age and country. First I lost my brave and\\nlion-hearted husband, who had every good quality under heaven, and whose\\nname was great over all Hellas and middle Argos, and now my darling son\\nis at the mercy of the winds and waves, without my having heard one word\\nabout his leaving home. You hussies, there was not one of you would so\\nmuch as think of giving me a call out of my bed, though you all of you\\nvery well knew when he was starting. If I had known he meant taking this\\nvoyage, he would have had to give it up, no matter how much he was bent\\nupon it, or leave me a corpse behind him--one or other. Now, however,\\ngo some of you and call old Dolius, who was given me by my father on my\\nmarriage, and who is my gardener. Bid him go at once and tell everything\\nto Laertes, who may be able to hit on some plan for enlisting public\\nsympathy on our side, as against those who are trying to exterminate his\\nown race and that of Ulysses.\"\\n\\nThen the dear old nurse Euryclea said, \"You may kill me, Madam, or let\\nme live on in your house, whichever you please, but I will tell you the\\nreal truth. I knew all about it, and gave him everything he wanted in\\nthe way of bread and wine, but he made me take my solemn oath that I\\nwould not tell you anything for some ten or twelve days, unless you\\nasked or happened to hear of his having gone, for he did not want you to\\nspoil your beauty by crying. And now, Madam, wash your face, change\\nyour dress, and go upstairs with your maids to offer prayers to Minerva,\\ndaughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, for she can save him even though he\\nbe in the jaws of death. Do not trouble Laertes: he has trouble enough\\nalready. Besides, I cannot think that the gods hate the race of the son\\nof Arceisius so much, but there will be a son left to come up after him,\\nand inherit both the house and the fair fields that lie far all round\\nit.\"\\n\\nWith these words she made her mistress leave off crying, and dried the\\ntears from her eyes. Penelope washed her face, changed her dress, and\\nwent upstairs with her maids. She then put some bruised barley into a\\nbasket and began praying to Minerva.\\n\\n\"Hear me,\" she cried, \"Daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable. If\\never Ulysses while he was here burned you fat thigh bones of sheep or\\nheifer, bear it in mind now as in my favour, and save my darling son\\nfrom the villainy of the suitors.\"\\n\\nShe cried aloud as she spoke, and the goddess heard her prayer;\\nmeanwhile the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloister,\\nand one of them said:\\n\\n\"The queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us. Little\\ndoes she dream that her son has now been doomed to die.\"\\n\\nThis was what they said, but they did not know what was going to happen.\\nThen Antinous said, \"Comrades, let there be no loud talking, lest some\\nof it get carried inside. Let us be up and do that in silence, about\\nwhich we are all of a mind.\"\\n\\nHe then chose twenty men, and they went down to their ship and to the\\nsea side; they drew the vessel into the water and got her mast and sails\\ninside her; they bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs\\nof leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails aloft, while\\ntheir fine servants brought them their armour. Then they made the ship\\nfast a little way out, came on shore again, got their suppers, and\\nwaited till night should fall.\\n\\nBut Penelope lay in her own room upstairs unable to eat or drink, and\\nwondering whether her brave son would escape, or be overpowered by the\\nwicked suitors. Like a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmen hemming\\nher in on every side she thought and thought till she sank into a\\nslumber, and lay on her bed bereft of thought and motion.\\n\\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter, and made a vision in\\nthe likeness of Penelope\\'s sister Iphthime daughter of Icarius who had\\nmarried Eumelus and lived in Pherae. She told the vision to go to the\\nhouse of Ulysses, and to make Penelope leave off crying, so it came into\\nher room by the hole through which the thong went for pulling the door\\nto, and hovered over her head saying,\\n\\n\"You are asleep, Penelope: the gods who live at ease will not suffer you\\nto weep and be so sad. Your son has done them no wrong, so he will yet\\ncome back to you.\"\\n\\nPenelope, who was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland, answered,\\n\"Sister, why have you come here? You do not come very often, but I\\nsuppose that is because you live such a long way off. Am I, then, to\\nleave off crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts that torture me?\\nI, who have lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, who had every good\\nquality under heaven, and whose name was great over all Hellas and\\nmiddle Argos; and now my darling son has gone off on board of a ship--a\\nfoolish fellow who has never been used to roughing it, nor to going\\nabout among gatherings of men. I am even more anxious about him than\\nabout my husband; I am all in a tremble when I think of him, lest\\nsomething should happen to him, either from the people among whom he has\\ngone, or by sea, for he has many enemies who are plotting against him,\\nand are bent on killing him before he can return home.\"\\n\\nThen the vision said, \"Take heart, and be not so much dismayed. There is\\none gone with him whom many a man would be glad enough to have stand by\\nhis side, I mean Minerva; it is she who has compassion upon you, and who\\nhas sent me to bear you this message.\"\\n\\n\"Then,\" said Penelope, \"if you are a god or have been sent here by\\ndivine commission, tell me also about that other unhappy one--is he\\nstill alive, or is he already dead and in the house of Hades?\"\\n\\nAnd the vision said, \"I shall not tell you for certain whether he is\\nalive or dead, and there is no use in idle conversation.\"\\n\\nThen it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and was dissipated\\ninto thin air; but Penelope rose from her sleep refreshed and comforted,\\nso vivid had been her dream.\\n\\nMeantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the\\nsea, intent on murdering Telemachus. Now there is a rocky islet called\\nAsteris, of no great size, in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos, and\\nthere is a harbour on either side of it where a ship can lie. Here then\\nthe Achaeans placed themselves in ambush.',\n",
       " 'BOOK XXII\\n\\n  The death of Hector.\\n\\nTHUS the Trojans in the city, scared like fawns, wiped the sweat from\\noff them and drank to quench their thirst, leaning against the goodly\\nbattlements, while the Achaeans with their shields laid upon their\\nshoulders drew close up to the walls. But stern fate bade Hector stay\\nwhere he was before Ilius and the Scaean gates. Then Phoebus Apollo\\nspoke to the son of Peleus saying, \"Why, son of Peleus, do you, who are\\nbut man, give chase to me who am immortal? Have you not yet found out\\nthat it is a god whom you pursue so furiously? You did not harass the\\nTrojans whom you had routed, and now they are within their walls, while\\nyou have been decoyed hither away from them. Me you cannot kill, for\\ndeath can take no hold upon me.\"\\n\\nAchilles was greatly angered and said, \"You have baulked me,\\nFar-Darter, most malicious of all gods, and have drawn me away from the\\nwall, where many another man would have bitten the dust ere he got\\nwithin Ilius; you have robbed me of great glory and have saved the\\nTrojans at no risk to yourself, for you have nothing to fear, but I\\nwould indeed have my revenge if it were in my power to do so.\"\\n\\nOn this, with fell intent he made towards the city, and as the winning\\nhorse in a chariot race strains every nerve when he is flying over the\\nplain, even so fast and furiously did the limbs of Achilles bear him\\nonwards. King Priam was first to note him as he scoured the plain, all\\nradiant as the star which men call Orion\\'s Hound, and whose beams blaze\\nforth in time of harvest more brilliantly than those of any other that\\nshines by night; brightest of them all though he be, he yet bodes ill\\nfor mortals, for he brings fire and fever in his train--even so did\\nAchilles\\' armour gleam on his breast as he sped onwards. Priam raised a\\ncry and beat his head with his hands as he lifted them up and shouted\\nout to his dear son, imploring him to return; but Hector still stayed\\nbefore the gates, for his heart was set upon doing battle with\\nAchilles. The old man reached out his arms towards him and bade him for\\npity\\'s sake come within the walls. \"Hector,\" he cried, \"my son, stay\\nnot to face this man alone and unsupported, or you will meet death at\\nthe hands of the son of Peleus, for he is mightier than you. Monster\\nthat he is; would indeed that the gods loved him no better than I do,\\nfor so, dogs and vultures would soon devour him as he lay stretched on\\nearth, and a load of grief would be lifted from my heart, for many a\\nbrave son has he reft from me, either by killing them or selling them\\naway in the islands that are beyond the sea: even now I miss two sons\\nfrom among the Trojans who have thronged within the city, Lycaon and\\nPolydorus, whom Laothoe peeress among women bore me. Should they be\\nstill alive and in the hands of the Achaeans, we will ransom them with\\ngold and bronze, of which we have store, for the old man Altes endowed\\nhis daughter richly; but if they are already dead and in the house of\\nHades, sorrow will it be to us two who were their parents; albeit the\\ngrief of others will be more short-lived unless you too perish at the\\nhands of Achilles. Come, then, my son, within the city, to be the\\nguardian of Trojan men and Trojan women, or you will both lose your own\\nlife and afford a mighty triumph to the son of Peleus. Have pity also\\non your unhappy father while life yet remains to him--on me, whom the\\nson of Saturn will destroy by a terrible doom on the threshold of old\\nage, after I have seen my sons slain and my daughters haled away as\\ncaptives, my bridal chambers pillaged, little children dashed to earth\\namid the rage of battle, and my sons\\' wives dragged away by the cruel\\nhands of the Achaeans; in the end fierce hounds will tear me in pieces\\nat my own gates after some one has beaten the life out of my body with\\nsword or spear-hounds that I myself reared and fed at my own table to\\nguard my gates, but who will yet lap my blood and then lie all\\ndistraught at my doors. When a young man falls by the sword in battle,\\nhe may lie where he is and there is nothing unseemly; let what will be\\nseen, all is honourable in death, but when an old man is slain there is\\nnothing in this world more pitiable than that dogs should defile his\\ngrey hair and beard and all that men hide for shame.\"\\n\\nThe old man tore his grey hair as he spoke, but he moved not the heart\\nof Hector. His mother hard by wept and moaned aloud as she bared her\\nbosom and pointed to the breast which had suckled him. \"Hector,\" she\\ncried, weeping bitterly the while, \"Hector, my son, spurn not this\\nbreast, but have pity upon me too: if I have ever given you comfort\\nfrom my own bosom, think on it now, dear son, and come within the wall\\nto protect us from this man; stand not without to meet him. Should the\\nwretch kill you, neither I nor your richly dowered wife shall ever\\nweep, dear offshoot of myself, over the bed on which you lie, for dogs\\nwill devour you at the ships of the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nThus did the two with many tears implore their son, but they moved not\\nthe heart of Hector, and he stood his ground awaiting huge Achilles as\\nhe drew nearer towards him. As a serpent in its den upon the mountains,\\nfull fed with deadly poisons, waits for the approach of man--he is\\nfilled with fury and his eyes glare terribly as he goes writhing round\\nhis den--even so Hector leaned his shield against a tower that jutted\\nout from the wall and stood where he was, undaunted.\\n\\n\"Alas,\" said he to himself in the heaviness of his heart, \"if I go\\nwithin the gates, Polydamas will be the first to heap reproach upon me,\\nfor it was he that urged me to lead the Trojans back to the city on\\nthat awful night when Achilles again came forth against us. I would not\\nlisten, but it would have been indeed better if I had done so. Now that\\nmy folly has destroyed the host, I dare not look Trojan men and Trojan\\nwomen in the face, lest a worse man should say, \\'Hector has ruined us\\nby his self-confidence.\\' Surely it would be better for me to return\\nafter having fought Achilles and slain him, or to die gloriously here\\nbefore the city. What, again, if I were to lay down my shield and\\nhelmet, lean my spear against the wall and go straight up to noble\\nAchilles? What if I were to promise to give up Helen, who was the\\nfountainhead of all this war, and all the treasure that Alexandrus\\nbrought with him in his ships to Troy, aye, and to let the Achaeans\\ndivide the half of everything that the city contains among themselves?\\nI might make the Trojans, by the mouths of their princes, take a solemn\\noath that they would hide nothing, but would divide into two shares all\\nthat is within the city--but why argue with myself in this way? Were I\\nto go up to him he would show me no kind of mercy; he would kill me\\nthen and there as easily as though I were a woman, when I had off my\\narmour. There is no parleying with him from some rock or oak tree as\\nyoung men and maidens prattle with one another. Better fight him at\\nonce, and learn to which of us Jove will vouchsafe victory.\"\\n\\nThus did he stand and ponder, but Achilles came up to him as it were\\nMars himself, plumed lord of battle. From his right shoulder he\\nbrandished his terrible spear of Pelian ash, and the bronze gleamed\\naround him like flashing fire or the rays of the rising sun. Fear fell\\nupon Hector as he beheld him, and he dared not stay longer where he was\\nbut fled in dismay from before the gates, while Achilles darted after\\nhim at his utmost speed. As a mountain falcon, swiftest of all birds,\\nswoops down upon some cowering dove--the dove flies before him but the\\nfalcon with a shrill scream follows close after, resolved to have\\nher--even so did Achilles make straight for Hector with all his might,\\nwhile Hector fled under the Trojan wall as fast as his limbs could take\\nhim.\\n\\nOn they flew along the waggon-road that ran hard by under the wall,\\npast the lookout station, and past the weather-beaten wild fig-tree,\\ntill they came to two fair springs which feed the river Scamander. One\\nof these two springs is warm, and steam rises from it as smoke from a\\nburning fire, but the other even in summer is as cold as hail or snow,\\nor the ice that forms on water. Here, hard by the springs, are the\\ngoodly washing-troughs of stone, where in the time of peace before the\\ncoming of the Achaeans the wives and fair daughters of the Trojans used\\nto wash their clothes. Past these did they fly, the one in front and\\nthe other giving chase behind him: good was the man that fled, but\\nbetter far was he that followed after, and swiftly indeed did they run,\\nfor the prize was no mere beast for sacrifice or bullock\\'s hide, as it\\nmight be for a common foot-race, but they ran for the life of Hector.\\nAs horses in a chariot race speed round the turning-posts when they are\\nrunning for some great prize--a tripod or woman--at the games in honour\\nof some dead hero, so did these two run full speed three times round\\nthe city of Priam. All the gods watched them, and the sire of gods and\\nmen was the first to speak.\\n\\n\"Alas,\" said he, \"my eyes behold a man who is dear to me being pursued\\nround the walls of Troy; my heart is full of pity for Hector, who has\\nburned the thigh-bones of many a heifer in my honour, one while on the\\ncrests of many-valleyed Ida, and again on the citadel of Troy; and now\\nI see noble Achilles in full pursuit of him round the city of Priam.\\nWhat say you? Consider among yourselves and decide whether we shall now\\nsave him or let him fall, valiant though he be, before Achilles, son of\\nPeleus.\"\\n\\nThen Minerva said, \"Father, wielder of the lightning, lord of cloud and\\nstorm, what mean you? Would you pluck this mortal whose doom has long\\nbeen decreed out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we others\\nshall not be of a mind with you.\"\\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"My child, Trito-born, take heart. I did not speak\\nin full earnest, and I will let you have your way. Do without let or\\nhindrance as you are minded.\"\\n\\nThus did he urge Minerva who was already eager, and down she darted\\nfrom the topmost summits of Olympus.\\n\\nAchilles was still in full pursuit of Hector, as a hound chasing a fawn\\nwhich he has started from its covert on the mountains, and hunts\\nthrough glade and thicket. The fawn may try to elude him by crouching\\nunder cover of a bush, but he will scent her out and follow her up\\nuntil he gets her--even so there was no escape for Hector from the\\nfleet son of Peleus. Whenever he made a set to get near the Dardanian\\ngates and under the walls, that his people might help him by showering\\ndown weapons from above, Achilles would gain on him and head him back\\ntowards the plain, keeping himself always on the city side. As a man in\\na dream who fails to lay hands upon another whom he is pursuing--the\\none cannot escape nor the other overtake--even so neither could\\nAchilles come up with Hector, nor Hector break away from Achilles;\\nnevertheless he might even yet have escaped death had not the time come\\nwhen Apollo, who thus far had sustained his strength and nerved his\\nrunning, was now no longer to stay by him. Achilles made signs to the\\nAchaean host, and shook his head to show that no man was to aim a dart\\nat Hector, lest another might win the glory of having hit him and he\\nmight himself come in second. Then, at last, as they were nearing the\\nfountains for the fourth time, the father of all balanced his golden\\nscales and placed a doom in each of them, one for Achilles and the\\nother for Hector. As he held the scales by the middle, the doom of\\nHector fell down deep into the house of Hades--and then Phoebus Apollo\\nleft him. Thereon Minerva went close up to the son of Peleus and said,\\n\"Noble Achilles, favoured of heaven, we two shall surely take back to\\nthe ships a triumph for the Achaeans by slaying Hector, for all his\\nlust of battle. Do what Apollo may as he lies grovelling before his\\nfather, aegis-bearing Jove, Hector cannot escape us longer. Stay here\\nand take breath, while I go up to him and persuade him to make a stand\\nand fight you.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Minerva. Achilles obeyed her gladly, and stood still,\\nleaning on his bronze-pointed ashen spear, while Minerva left him and\\nwent after Hector in the form and with the voice of Deiphobus. She came\\nclose up to him and said, \"Dear brother, I see you are hard pressed by\\nAchilles who is chasing you at full speed round the city of Priam, let\\nus await his onset and stand on our defence.\"\\n\\nAnd Hector answered, \"Deiphobus, you have always been dearest to me of\\nall my brothers, children of Hecuba and Priam, but henceforth I shall\\nrate you yet more highly, inasmuch as you have ventured outside the\\nwall for my sake when all the others remain inside.\"\\n\\nThen Minerva said, \"Dear brother, my father and mother went down on\\ntheir knees and implored me, as did all my comrades, to remain inside,\\nso great a fear has fallen upon them all; but I was in an agony of\\ngrief when I beheld you; now, therefore, let us two make a stand and\\nfight, and let there be no keeping our spears in reserve, that we may\\nlearn whether Achilles shall kill us and bear off our spoils to the\\nships, or whether he shall fall before you.\"\\n\\nThus did Minerva inveigle him by her cunning, and when the two were now\\nclose to one another great Hector was first to speak. \"I will no longer\\nfly you, son of Peleus,\" said he, \"as I have been doing hitherto. Three\\ntimes have I fled round the mighty city of Priam, without daring to\\nwithstand you, but now, let me either slay or be slain, for I am in the\\nmind to face you. Let us, then, give pledges to one another by our\\ngods, who are the fittest witnesses and guardians of all covenants; let\\nit be agreed between us that if Jove vouchsafes me the longer stay and\\nI take your life, I am not to treat your dead body in any unseemly\\nfashion, but when I have stripped you of your armour, I am to give up\\nyour body to the Achaeans. And do you likewise.\"\\n\\nAchilles glared at him and answered, \"Fool, prate not to me about\\ncovenants. There can be no covenants between men and lions, wolves and\\nlambs can never be of one mind, but hate each other out and out all\\nthrough. Therefore there can be no understanding between you and me,\\nnor may there be any covenants between us, till one or other shall fall\\nand glut grim Mars with his life\\'s blood. Put forth all your strength;\\nyou have need now to prove yourself indeed a bold soldier and man of\\nwar. You have no more chance, and Pallas Minerva will forthwith\\nvanquish you by my spear: you shall now pay me in full for the grief\\nyou have caused me on account of my comrades whom you have killed in\\nbattle.\"\\n\\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. Hector saw it coming and\\navoided it; he watched it and crouched down so that it flew over his\\nhead and stuck in the ground beyond; Minerva then snatched it up and\\ngave it back to Achilles without Hector\\'s seeing her; Hector thereon\\nsaid to the son of Peleus, \"You have missed your aim, Achilles, peer of\\nthe gods, and Jove has not yet revealed to you the hour of my doom,\\nthough you made sure that he had done so. You were a false-tongued liar\\nwhen you deemed that I should forget my valour and quail before you.\\nYou shall not drive your spear into the back of a runaway--drive it,\\nshould heaven so grant you power, drive it into me as I make straight\\ntowards you; and now for your own part avoid my spear if you can--would\\nthat you might receive the whole of it into your body; if you were once\\ndead the Trojans would find the war an easier matter, for it is you who\\nhave harmed them most.\"\\n\\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. His aim was true for he\\nhit the middle of Achilles\\' shield, but the spear rebounded from it,\\nand did not pierce it. Hector was angry when he saw that the weapon had\\nsped from his hand in vain, and stood there in dismay for he had no\\nsecond spear. With a loud cry he called Deiphobus and asked him for\\none, but there was no man; then he saw the truth and said to himself,\\n\"Alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. I deemed that the\\nhero Deiphobus was by my side, but he is within the wall, and Minerva\\nhas inveigled me; death is now indeed exceedingly near at hand and\\nthere is no way out of it--for so Jove and his son Apollo the\\nfar-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever ready\\nto protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then die\\ningloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some great\\nthing that shall be told among men hereafter.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he drew the keen blade that hung so great and strong by his\\nside, and gathering himself together be sprang on Achilles like a\\nsoaring eagle which swoops down from the clouds on to some lamb or\\ntimid hare--even so did Hector brandish his sword and spring upon\\nAchilles. Achilles mad with rage darted towards him, with his wondrous\\nshield before his breast, and his gleaming helmet, made with four\\nlayers of metal, nodding fiercely forward. The thick tresses of gold\\nwith which Vulcan had crested the helmet floated round it, and as the\\nevening star that shines brighter than all others through the stillness\\nof night, even such was the gleam of the spear which Achilles poised in\\nhis right hand, fraught with the death of noble Hector. He eyed his\\nfair flesh over and over to see where he could best wound it, but all\\nwas protected by the goodly armour of which Hector had spoiled\\nPatroclus after he had slain him, save only the throat where the\\ncollar-bones divide the neck from the shoulders, and this is a most\\ndeadly place: here then did Achilles strike him as he was coming on\\ntowards him, and the point of his spear went right through the fleshy\\npart of the neck, but it did not sever his windpipe so that he could\\nstill speak. Hector fell headlong, and Achilles vaunted over him\\nsaying, \"Hector, you deemed that you should come off scatheless when\\nyou were spoiling Patroclus, and recked not of myself who was not with\\nhim. Fool that you were: for I, his comrade, mightier far than he, was\\nstill left behind him at the ships, and now I have laid you low. The\\nAchaeans shall give him all due funeral rites, while dogs and vultures\\nshall work their will upon yourself.\"\\n\\nThen Hector said, as the life ebbed out of him, \"I pray you by your\\nlife and knees, and by your parents, let not dogs devour me at the\\nships of the Achaeans, but accept the rich treasure of gold and bronze\\nwhich my father and mother will offer you, and send my body home, that\\nthe Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire when I am dead.\"\\n\\nAchilles glared at him and answered, \"Dog, talk not to me neither of\\nknees nor parents; would that I could be as sure of being able to cut\\nyour flesh into pieces and eat it raw, for the ill you have done me, as\\nI am that nothing shall save you from the dogs--it shall not be, though\\nthey bring ten or twenty-fold ransom and weigh it out for me on the\\nspot, with promise of yet more hereafter. Though Priam son of Dardanus\\nshould bid them offer me your weight in gold, even so your mother shall\\nnever lay you out and make lament over the son she bore, but dogs and\\nvultures shall eat you utterly up.\"\\n\\nHector with his dying breath then said, \"I know you what you are, and\\nwas sure that I should not move you, for your heart is hard as iron;\\nlook to it that I bring not heaven\\'s anger upon you on the day when\\nParis and Phoebus Apollo, valiant though you be, shall slay you at the\\nScaean gates.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus said the shrouds of death enfolded him, whereon his\\nsoul went out of him and flew down to the house of Hades, lamenting its\\nsad fate that it should enjoy youth and strength no longer. But\\nAchilles said, speaking to the dead body, \"Die; for my part I will\\naccept my fate whensoever Jove and the other gods see fit to send it.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he drew his spear from the body and set it on one side;\\nthen he stripped the blood-stained armour from Hector\\'s shoulders while\\nthe other Achaeans came running up to view his wondrous strength and\\nbeauty; and no one came near him without giving him a fresh wound. Then\\nwould one turn to his neighbour and say, \"It is easier to handle Hector\\nnow than when he was flinging fire on to our ships\"--and as he spoke he\\nwould thrust his spear into him anew.\\n\\nWhen Achilles had done spoiling Hector of his armour, he stood among\\nthe Argives and said, \"My friends, princes and counsellors of the\\nArgives, now that heaven has vouchsafed us to overcome this man, who\\nhas done us more hurt than all the others together, consider whether we\\nshould not attack the city in force, and discover in what mind the\\nTrojans may be. We should thus learn whether they will desert their\\ncity now that Hector has fallen, or will still hold out even though he\\nis no longer living. But why argue with myself in this way, while\\nPatroclus is still lying at the ships unburied, and unmourned--he whom\\nI can never forget so long as I am alive and my strength fails not?\\nThough men forget their dead when once they are within the house of\\nHades, yet not even there will I forget the comrade whom I have lost.\\nNow, therefore, Achaean youths, let us raise the song of victory and go\\nback to the ships taking this man along with us; for we have achieved a\\nmighty triumph and have slain noble Hector to whom the Trojans prayed\\nthroughout their city as though he were a god.\"\\n\\nOn this he treated the body of Hector with contumely: he pierced the\\nsinews at the back of both his feet from heel to ancle and passed\\nthongs of ox-hide through the slits he had made: thus he made the body\\nfast to his chariot, letting the head trail upon the ground. Then when\\nhe had put the goodly armour on the chariot and had himself mounted, he\\nlashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing loth. The dust rose\\nfrom Hector as he was being dragged along, his dark hair flew all\\nabroad, and his head once so comely was laid low on earth, for Jove had\\nnow delivered him into the hands of his foes to do him outrage in his\\nown land.\\n\\nThus was the head of Hector being dishonoured in the dust. His mother\\ntore her hair, and flung her veil from her with a loud cry as she\\nlooked upon her son. His father made piteous moan, and throughout the\\ncity the people fell to weeping and wailing. It was as though the whole\\nof frowning Ilius was being smirched with fire. Hardly could the people\\nhold Priam back in his hot haste to rush without the gates of the city.\\nHe grovelled in the mire and besought them, calling each one of them by\\nhis name. \"Let be, my friends,\" he cried, \"and for all your sorrow,\\nsuffer me to go single-handed to the ships of the Achaeans. Let me\\nbeseech this cruel and terrible man, if maybe he will respect the\\nfeeling of his fellow-men, and have compassion on my old age. His own\\nfather is even such another as myself--Peleus, who bred him and reared\\nhim to be the bane of us Trojans, and of myself more than of all\\nothers. Many a son of mine has he slain in the flower of his youth, and\\nyet, grieve for these as I may, I do so for one--Hector--more than for\\nthem all, and the bitterness of my sorrow will bring me down to the\\nhouse of Hades. Would that he had died in my arms, for so both his\\nill-starred mother who bore him, and myself, should have had the\\ncomfort of weeping and mourning over him.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak with many tears, and all the people of the city\\njoined in his lament. Hecuba then raised the cry of wailing among the\\nTrojans. \"Alas, my son,\" she cried, \"what have I left to live for now\\nthat you are no more? Night and day did I glory in you throughout the\\ncity, for you were a tower of strength to all in Troy, and both men and\\nwomen alike hailed you as a god. So long as you lived you were their\\npride, but now death and destruction have fallen upon you.\"\\n\\nHector\\'s wife had as yet heard nothing, for no one had come to tell her\\nthat her husband had remained without the gates. She was at her loom in\\nan inner part of the house, weaving a double purple web, and\\nembroidering it with many flowers. She told her maids to set a large\\ntripod on the fire, so as to have a warm bath ready for Hector when he\\ncame out of battle; poor woman, she knew not that he was now beyond the\\nreach of baths, and that Minerva had laid him low by the hands of\\nAchilles. She heard the cry coming as from the wall, and trembled in\\nevery limb; the shuttle fell from her hands, and again she spoke to her\\nwaiting-women. \"Two of you,\" she said, \"come with me that I may learn\\nwhat it is that has befallen; I heard the voice of my husband\\'s\\nhonoured mother; my own heart beats as though it would come into my\\nmouth and my limbs refuse to carry me; some great misfortune for\\nPriam\\'s children must be at hand. May I never live to hear it, but I\\ngreatly fear that Achilles has cut off the retreat of brave Hector and\\nhas chased him on to the plain where he was singlehanded; I fear he may\\nhave put an end to the reckless daring which possessed my husband, who\\nwould never remain with the body of his men, but would dash on far in\\nfront, foremost of them all in valour.\"\\n\\nHer heart beat fast, and as she spoke she flew from the house like a\\nmaniac, with her waiting-women following after. When she reached the\\nbattlements and the crowd of people, she stood looking out upon the\\nwall, and saw Hector being borne away in front of the city--the horses\\ndragging him without heed or care over the ground towards the ships of\\nthe Achaeans. Her eyes were then shrouded as with the darkness of night\\nand she fell fainting backwards. She tore the attiring from her head\\nand flung it from her, the frontlet and net with its plaited band, and\\nthe veil which golden Venus had given her on the day when Hector took\\nher with him from the house of Eetion, after having given countless\\ngifts of wooing for her sake. Her husband\\'s sisters and the wives of\\nhis brothers crowded round her and supported her, for she was fain to\\ndie in her distraction; when she again presently breathed and came to\\nherself, she sobbed and made lament among the Trojans saying, \"Woe is\\nme, O Hector; woe, indeed, that to share a common lot we were born, you\\nat Troy in the house of Priam, and I at Thebes under the wooded\\nmountain of Placus in the house of Eetion who brought me up when I was\\na child--ill-starred sire of an ill-starred daughter--would that he had\\nnever begotten me. You are now going into the house of Hades under the\\nsecret places of the earth, and you leave me a sorrowing widow in your\\nhouse. The child, of whom you and I are the unhappy parents, is as yet\\na mere infant. Now that you are gone, O Hector, you can do nothing for\\nhim nor he for you. Even though he escape the horrors of this woeful\\nwar with the Achaeans, yet shall his life henceforth be one of labour\\nand sorrow, for others will seize his lands. The day that robs a child\\nof his parents severs him from his own kind; his head is bowed, his\\ncheeks are wet with tears, and he will go about destitute among the\\nfriends of his father, plucking one by the cloak and another by the\\nshirt. Some one or other of these may so far pity him as to hold the\\ncup for a moment towards him and let him moisten his lips, but he must\\nnot drink enough to wet the roof of his mouth; then one whose parents\\nare alive will drive him from the table with blows and angry words.\\n\\'Out with you,\\' he will say, \\'you have no father here,\\' and the child\\nwill go crying back to his widowed mother--he, Astyanax, who erewhile\\nwould sit upon his father\\'s knees, and have none but the daintiest and\\nchoicest morsels set before him. When he had played till he was tired\\nand went to sleep, he would lie in a bed, in the arms of his nurse, on\\na soft couch, knowing neither want nor care, whereas now that he has\\nlost his father his lot will be full of hardship--he, whom the Trojans\\nname Astyanax, because you, O Hector, were the only defence of their\\ngates and battlements. The wriggling writhing worms will now eat you at\\nthe ships, far from your parents, when the dogs have glutted themselves\\nupon you. You will lie naked, although in your house you have fine and\\ngoodly raiment made by hands of women. This will I now burn; it is of\\nno use to you, for you can never again wear it, and thus you will have\\nrespect shown you by the Trojans both men and women.\"\\n\\nIn such wise did she cry aloud amid her tears, and the women joined in\\nher lament.']"
